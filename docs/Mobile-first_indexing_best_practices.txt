Mobile-first indexing best practices
Mobile-first indexing means Google predominantly uses the mobile version of the content for
indexing and ranking. Historically, the index primarily used the desktop version of a page's content
when evaluating the relevance of a page to a user's query. Since the majority of users now access
Google Search with a mobile device, Googlebot primarily crawls and indexes pages with the
smartphone agent going forward.
Starting July 1, 2019, mobile-first indexing is enabled by default for all new websites (new to
the web or previously unknown to Google Search). For older or existing websites, we continue to
monitor and evaluate pages based on the best practices detailed in this guide. We inform site
owners in Search Console of the date when their site was switched to mobile-first indexing.
It's important to note that there isn't a separate mobile-first index; Google
Search continues to use only one index. Google Search continues to show the URL that is the most
appropriate to users (whether it's a desktop or mobile URL) in Search results.
To make sure that your users have the best experience, follow the best practices detailed in this guide.
Make sure that Googlebot can access and render your content
Make sure that Googlebot can access and render your mobile page content and resources.
Use the same meta robots tags on the mobile and desktop site.
If you use a different meta robots tag on the mobile site (especially noindex or
nofollow), Google may fail to crawl and index your page when your site is enabled
for mobile-first indexing.
Don't lazy-load primary content upon user interaction. Googlebot won't load
content that requires user interactions (for example, swiping, clicking, or typing) to load.
Make sure that Google can see
lazy-loaded content.
Let Google crawl your resources. Some resources have different URLs on the
mobile site from those on the desktop site. If you want Google to crawl your URLs, make sure
that you're not blocking the URL with the disallow directive.
Make sure that content is the same on desktop and mobile
Make sure that your mobile site contains the same content as your desktop site.
If your mobile site has less content than your desktop site, consider updating your mobile
site so that its primary content is equivalent to your desktop site. Almost all indexing on
your site comes from the mobile site.
WARNING: If it’s your intention that the mobile page
should have less content than the desktop page, you can expect some traffic loss
when your site is enabled mobile-first indexing, since Google can't get as much information
from your page as before.
Use the same clear and meaningful headings on the mobile site
as you do on the desktop site.
Even with the equivalent content, differences in DOM or layout between desktop and mobile page
can result in Google understanding the content differently.
Check your structured data
If you have structured data on your site, make sure that it's present on both versions of your site.
Here are some specific things to check:
Make sure that your mobile and desktop sites have the same structured data.
If you have to prioritize which types you add to your mobile site, start with
Breadcrumb,
Product, and
VideoObject structured data.
Use correct URLs in structured data. Make sure that URLs in the structured data
on the mobile versions are updated to the mobile URLs.
If you use Data Highlighter, train it on your mobile site. If you use
Data Highlighter to provide
structured data, regularly check the
Data Highlighter
dashboard for extraction errors.
Put the same metadata on both versions of your site
Make sure that the descriptive
title and meta
description are equivalent across both versions of your site.
Check the placement of your ads
Don’t let ads harm your mobile page ranking. Follow the
Better Ads Standard when
displaying ads on mobile devices. For example, ads at the top of the page can take up too much
room on a mobile device, which is a bad user experience
Check
visual content
Check your images
Make sure that the images on your mobile site follow the
image best
practices. In particular, we recommend that you:
Provide high quality
images. Don’t use images that are too small or have a
low resolution on the mobile site.
Use a supported
format for images. Don’t use unsupported formats or tags.
For example, Google supports SVG format images, but our systems can’t index a .jpg image in
the <image> tag inside an inline SVG.
Don't use URLs that change every time the page loads for images. Google
won’t be able to process and index your resources properly if you use constantly-changing URLs
for them.
Make sure that the mobile site has the same alt text for images as the desktop site.
Use descriptive
alt text for images on your mobile site as you do on your desktop site.
Make sure that the mobile page content quality is as good as the desktop page.
Use the same descriptive titles, captions, filenames, and text relevant to the images on the
mobile site as you do for the desktop site.
If your site is using different image URLs for the desktop and
mobile site, you may see a temporary image traffic loss while your site transitions to mobile-first
indexing. This is because the image URLs on the mobile site are new to Google
indexing, and it will take some time for the new image URLs to gain enough historical search
results to get a better ranking. To avoid a temporary image traffic loss, use the same image URLs
across both versions of your site. If you don't mind a temporary image traffic loss, you don't need to
take any action.
Check your videos
Make sure that the videos on your mobile site follow the
video best
practices. In particular, we recommend that you:
Don't use URLs that change every time the page loads for your videos.
Google won’t be able to process and index your resources properly if you use constantly
changing URLs for them.
Use a supported format
for your videos and put videos in supported tags. Videos are identified in
the page by the presence of an HTML tag, for example: <video>,
<embed>, or <object>.
Use the same video structured data on both your mobile site
and desktop site. For more information, check your structured data.
Place the video in an easy to find position on the page when viewed on a mobile device. For
example, it might harm the video’s ranking if users need to scroll down too much to find the
video on mobile page.
Additional best practices for separate URLs
If your site has separate URLs for the desktop and mobile versions of a page (also known as
m-dot), we recommend the following additional best practices:
Make sure that the error page status is the same on both the desktop and mobile sites. If a page on your desktop site serves normal contents and your mobile site's version of that page serves an error page, this page will be missing from the index.
Make sure that your mobile version doesn’t have fragment URLs. The fragment
part of the URL is the end of the URL that starts with #. Most of the time, fragment URLs are
not indexable, these pages will be missing from the index after your domain is enabled for mobile-first indexing.
Ensure that the desktop versions that serve different contents have equivalent mobile versions. If
different URLs redirects to the same URL, for example, homepage, on mobile devices, after your
domain is enabled for mobile-first indexing, all these pages will be missing from the index.
Verify both versions of your site in
Search Console to make sure that you have access to data
and messages for both versions. Your site may experience a data shift when Google switches to
mobile-first indexing for your site.
Check hreflang links on separate URLs. When you use rel=hreflang
link elements for
internationalization, link between
mobile and desktop URLs separately. Your mobile URLs' hreflang should point to mobile URLs, and
similarly desktop URL hreflang should point to desktop URLs.
Example of hreflang for separate URLs
Here's an example of hreflang for the homepage of a site with separate URLs for mobile and desktop.
Mobile
In this example, the mobile site URL is https://m.example.com/.
<link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/">
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="es" href="https://m.example.com/es/">
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="fr" href="https://m.example.com/fr/">
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="de" href="https://m.example.com/de/">
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="th" href="https://m.example.com/th/">
Desktop
In this example, the desktop site URL is https://example.com/.
<link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/">
<link rel="alternate" media="only screen and (max-width: 640px)" href="https://m.example.com/">
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="es" href="https://example.com/es/">
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="fr" href="https://example.com/fr/">
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="de" href="https://example.com/de/">
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="th" href="https://example.com/th/">
Ensure that your mobile site has enough capacity to handle a potential increase in
crawl rate on the mobile version of your site.
Verify that your robots.txt directives
work as you intend for both versions of your site. The robots.txt file lets you specify which parts of a
website may be crawled or not. In most cases, you should use the same robots.txt directives for
both mobile and desktop versions of your site.
Use the correct rel=canonical and rel=alternate link elements between your mobile and desktop versions.
Example of rel=canonical and rel=alternate for separate URLs
Here's an example of rel=canonical and rel=alternate for a separate URLs site setup.
Mobile
In this example, the mobile site URL is https://m.example.com/.
<link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/">
Desktop
In this example, the desktop site URL is https://example.com/.
<link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/">
<link rel="alternate" media="only screen and (max-width: 640px)" href="https://m.example.com/">
Troubleshooting
Here's a list of the most common errors that can stop sites from being enabled for mobile-first
indexing or could cause a drop in ranking after a site is enabled for mobile-first indexing. If
your site isn't enabled for mobile-first indexing yet, you've seen a drop in ranking after your
site is enabled for mobile-first indexing, or you've received a message in
Search Console, check the list of common errors and resolve possible errors you may have.
Errors
Missing structured data
error What caused the issue: The mobile page doesn't have all the structured
data markup that the desktop page has.
done Fix the issue
Verify that the structured data is present on both versions of your site (desktop and
mobile).
Make sure that your mobile and desktop sites have the same structured data.
Use correct URLs in structured data. Make sure that URLs in the structured data on the mobile
versions are updated to the correct URLs.
Check extraction errors for your structured data. If you use
Data Highlighter to
provide structured data, regularly check the
Data Highlighter
dashboard for extraction errors.
Use the URL Inspection
tool to check that the content is visible on the rendered page (the rendered page
is how Googlebot sees your page).
noindex tag on pages
error What caused the issue: A mobile page
is blocked from indexing by a noindex tag.
done Fix the issue: Use the same meta robots
tags on the mobile site and the desktop site. Don’t use the
noindex tag on the mobile page (otherwise, Google won't index your page when your site is
enabled for mobile-first indexing).
Missing image
error What caused the issue: The mobile page doesn't have all the important
images that the desktop page has.
done Fix the issue
Make sure that your mobile site contains the same content as your desktop site. If your mobile site
has less content than your desktop site, consider updating your mobile site so that its
primary content is equivalent with your desktop site. Only the content shown on the mobile site
is used for indexing.
Use the same meta robots tags on the mobile site and the desktop site. Don’t use
the nofollow tag on the mobile page (otherwise, Google won't crawl and index the
images on your page when your site is enabled for for mobile-first indexing).
Use a supported
format and tag for images. For example,
Google supports SVG format images, but our systems can’t index a .jpg image in the
<image> tag inside an inline SVG.
Don't lazy-load primary content upon user interaction. Googlebot won't load content that
requires user interactions (for example, swiping, clicking, or typing) to load.
Make sure that Google can see lazy-loaded
content.
Blocked image
error What caused the issue: An important image on the mobile page is blocked
by robots.txt.
done Fix the issue: Let Google crawl your
resources. Some images have different URLs on the mobile site from those
on the desktop site. If you want Google to crawl your URLs, don't block the
URL with the disallow directive.
Low quality image
error What caused the issue: An important image on the mobile page is too small
or low resolution.
done Fix the issue: Provide high quality
images. Don’t use images that are too small or have a low resolution on
the mobile site.
Missing alt text
error What caused the issue: An important image on the mobile page is missing
alt text.
done Fix the issue: Use the same descriptive
alt text for images on your mobile site as you do on your desktop site.
Missing page title
error What caused the issue: A mobile page is missing a title.
done Fix the issue: Make sure that the
titles
and meta
descriptions are equivalent across both versions of your site.
Missing meta description
error What caused the issue: A mobile page
is missing the meta description.
done Fix the issue: Make sure that the
titles
and meta
descriptions are equivalent across both versions of your site.
Mobile URL is an error page
error What caused the issue: The mobile page is an error page.
done Fix the issue: Make sure error page status
is the same across desktop and mobile site. If a page on your desktop site serves normal contents and your mobile site's version of that page serves an error page, this page will be missing from the index.
Mobile URL has anchor fragment
error What caused the issue: The mobile URL includes an anchor fragment; Google
can't index URLs that include fragments.
done Fix the issue: Make sure your mobile
version doesn’t have fragment URLs. Most of the time, fragment URLs are not
indexable, and these pages will be missing from the index after your domain is enabled for for mobile-first indexing.
Mobile page blocked by robots.txt
error What caused the issue: The mobile page is blocked by a robots.txt rule.
done Fix the issue: Verify that your robots.txt
directives and robots meta tags work as you intended for both versions
of your site. Use the same robots.txt directives for both mobile and desktop versions of your site.
Duplicate mobile page target
error What caused the issue: Multiple desktop pages redirect to the same mobile page.
done Fix the issue: Ensure desktop versions
which serve different contents have equivalent mobile versions. If
different URLs redirects to the same URL, on mobile devices, after your domain is enabled for
mobile-first indexing, all these pages will be missing from the index.
Desktop site redirects to the mobile homepage
error What caused the issue: Most or all pages on your desktop site redirect to
the mobile site's homepage.
done Fix the issue: Ensure the desktop version
has an equivalent mobile version. If different URLs redirect to the
homepage on mobile devices, all these pages will be missing from the index after your domain is migrated for
mobile-first indexing.
Page quality issues
error What caused the issue: The mobile page has issues with ads, missing
content, titles, or descriptive elements for images on the page.
done Fix the issue
Don’t let ads harm your mobile page ranking. Follow the
Better Ads Standard when
displaying ads on mobile devices.
Make sure your mobile site contains the same content as your desktop site. If your mobile
site has less content than your desktop site, consider updating your mobile site so that its
primary content is equivalent with your desktop site. Only the content shown on the mobile site
is used for indexing.
Make sure you use the same clear and meaningful headings on the mobile site as you do on the
desktop site.
Use the same descriptive titles, captions, filenames, and text relevant to the images on the
mobile site you do for the desktop site.
Video issues
error What caused the issue: The mobile page has a video that is not in a
supported format, is placed in a difficult to find location, is missing meta descriptions,
or is very slow to load.
done Fix the issue
Use a supported format
for your videos and put them in supported tags. Videos are identified in the page by the
presence of an HTML tag, for example: <video>, <embed>, or
<object>.
Don't lazy-load primary content upon user interaction. Googlebot won't load content that
requires user interactions (for example, swiping, clicking or typing) to load.
Make sure Google can see lazy-loaded
content.
Place the video in an easy to find location on your mobile site. For example, it might harm
the video’s ranking if users need to scroll down too much to find the video on mobile
page.
Hostload issues
error What caused the issue: Some of the
hosts don't have enough hostload.
done Fix the issue: Ensure that your mobile site
has enough capacity to handle a potential increase in
crawl rate on
the mobile version of your site.
