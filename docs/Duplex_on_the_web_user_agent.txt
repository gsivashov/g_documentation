Duplex on the Web user agent
DuplexWeb-Google is the user agent that supports the Duplex on the web service.
You can see the
user agent token and full user agent strings here.
Crawl frequency and behavior
No services that use the DuplexWeb-Google user agent will perform any purchases
or perform any other significant actions when crawling your site.
The DuplexWeb-Google user agent crawls occur a few times a day to a few times
an hour, depending on the feature being trained, but these runs are calculated to not
overload your site or disturb your traffic.
The DuplexWeb-Google user agent crawls are not used by Google Search for
indexing. Because they are not used for indexing, the DuplexWeb-Google user
agent does not recognize the
noindex directive.
Google Analytics does not record page requests made by the DuplexWeb-Google
user agent during crawling and analysis.
Use robots.txt rules to control crawling
You must explicitly block the DuplexWeb-Google user agent using the
Disallow robots.txt rule to prevent it from crawling your site.
Disabling crawling (training) in your Search Console property setting
is not enough.
The DuplexWeb-Google user agent obeys robots.txt rules normally, with the
following significant exceptions:
When Duplex on the web is
enabled using Search Console
(the default), the DuplexWeb-Google user agent ignores the
Disallow rules in the * wildcard user agent groups.
When Duplex on the web is disabled using Search Console, the DuplexWeb-Google
user agent respects Disallow rules in the * wildcard user agent
groups.
Examples:
# Example 1: Block DuplexWeb-Google from crawling your site
User-agent: DuplexWeb-Google
Disallow: /
# Example 2:
# * If Duplex on the web is enabled for this property in Search Console,
#
block all user agents except DuplexWeb-Google.
# * If Duplex on the web is disabled for this property in Search Console,
#
block all user agents including Duplex-WebGoogle.
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
