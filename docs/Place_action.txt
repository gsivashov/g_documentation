Place action
This documentation is deprecated as of June 17, 2019. We're no longer accepting
new markup-based Place Action partners. Instead, scheduling providers can use
the Maps Booking API. Google
Search continues to support existing partners that added Place Action structured data prior to
June 17, 2019.
A Place Action enables
users to make a reservation or order products or services, directly from the business listing in
Google Search and Maps.
Examples
Here's an example of location-based queries such as "nearby barbers" or "hair salons
within 15 miles".

Business markup can specify multiple Action types
and qualify the actions with other parameters. Depending upon your offering, you might mark up
your content with more than a single combination of actions and qualifying parameters.

Many other combinations of actions and parameters are possible. When developing more
complex business actions, be sure to use only a single value
in either
potentialAction.target.url OR potentialAction.target.urlTemplate.
The following illustrates some scenarios for using OrderAction
and ReserveAction types:
One OrderAction and one ReserveAction: A restaurant that accepts
delivery orders and table reservations.
One OrderAction for each provider: A restaurant that accepts delivery orders
from two different providers.
One ReserveAction for the following:
A yoga studio that offers different classes through
a single provider that includes all classes.
A hair salon that has multiple stylists, each with a unique menu of services
that includes all stylists.
Guidelines
You must follow these guidelines to be eligible for Place Actions.
Warning: If your site violates one or more of these guidelines,
then Google may take manual
action against it. Once you have remedied the problem, you can submit your site for reconsideration.
Technical guidelines
Webmaster guidelines
General structured data guidelines
Technical guidelines
Provide only a single value in either
potentialAction.target.url OR potentialAction.target.urlTemplate.
The target web page or app must let the user complete the action online. For
example, a web page that displays the menu of a restaurant is not a valid
action page if the user must make a telephone call to place an order or reserve
a table.
Structured data type definitions
Structured data in Google Search supports two types of business actions:
OrderAction—represents an order for products or services to be delivered.
ReserveAction—represents a reservation for a physical object such as a restaurant table,
automobile, or hotel room for a specific date and time.
The following two tables list the properties for each action type.
You must include the required properties for your content to be eligible for display as an action.
You can also include the recommended properties to add more information about your content,
which could provide a better user experience.
