Fact Check
If you have a web page that reviews a claim made by others, you can include
ClaimReview structured data on your web page. ClaimReview structured
data can enable a summarized version of your fact check to display in Google Search results
when your page appears in search results for that claim.
This guide describes the details on how to implement ClaimReview structured data.
If you don’t want to add structured data manually, you can check out the
Fact Check
Markup Tool. To learn more, visit
About the Fact Check
Markup Tool.
How to add structured data
Structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page
content. If you’re new to structured data, you can learn more about
how structured data works.
Here's an overview of how to build, test, and release structured data. For a step-by-step guide
on how to add structured data to a web page, check out the
structured
data codelab.
Add the required properties. For information about where to put
structured data on the page, watch JSON-LD structured
data: Where to insert on the page.
Follow the guidelines.
Validate your code using the
Rich Results Test.
Deploy a few pages that include your structured data and use the URL Inspection tool to test how Google sees the page. Be sure that your page is
accessible to Google and not blocked by a robots.txt file, the noindex tag, or
login requirements. If the page looks okay, you can
ask Google to
recrawl your URLs.
Note: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it
may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
To keep Google informed of future changes, we recommend that you
submit a
sitemap. You can automate this with the
Search Console Sitemap
API.
Example
Imagine a page that evaluates the claim that the earth is flat. Here is what a
search for "the world is flat" might look like in Google Search results if the page
provides a ClaimReview element (note that the actual visual design may change):
Here's an example of structured data on the page that hosts this fact check:

Eligibility guidelines
Google doesn't guarantee that fact checks will be shown in search results, even if your page is
marked up correctly according to the Rich Result Test. Using structured data enables a feature to be present,
it does not guarantee that it will be present. The Google algorithm programmatically
determines the eligibility for fact check rich results, depending on many variables, including
the following guidlelines.
For your fact check content to be eligible to display as a fact check rich result on Google
Search, you must meet the following guidelines:
Your site must have several pages marked with ClaimReview
structured data.
You must follow all the structured data
guidelines and webmaster
guidelines.
There must not be any mismatch between the structured data and page content (for example, if the
structured data indicated that the claim is true, but the content on the page said the
claim was false). Instead, make sure that both the content and structured data match (for
example, both indicate that the claim is true).
You must meet the standards for accountability, transparency, readability, and site
misrepresentation, as articulated in our
Google
News General Guidelines.
You must have a corrections policy or have a mechanism for users to report errors.
Websites for political entities (such as campaigns, parties, or elected officials) aren't
eligible for this feature.
Your readers can easily identify the claims and checks in the body of the article. Your
readers are able to understand what was checked and what conclusions were reached.
You must clearly attribute the specific claim that you're assessing to a distinct
origin (separate from your website), whether it's another website, public statement, social media, or other
traceable source.
Your fact check analysis must be traceable and transparent about sources and methods, with
citations and references to primary sources.
Technical guidelines
A single page can host multiple ClaimReview elements, each for a separate claim.
If different reviewers on the page check the same fact, you can include a
separate ClaimReview element for each reviewer's analysis. For more
information, visit Posting multiple fact checks on a page.
The page hosting the ClaimReview element must have at least a brief summary
of the fact check and the evaluation, if not the full text.
You should host a specific ClaimReview on only one page on your site. Do
not repeat the same fact check on multiple pages, unless they are variations of the same
page (for example, you can post the same ClaimReview on the mobile and desktop
versions of a page).
If your website aggregates fact-check articles, ensure that all articles match the above
criteria and that you provide an open and publicly available list of all fact-check websites
you aggregate.
Posting multiple fact checks on a page
At this time, Google Search is still exploring ways to surface multiple fact
checks. You may not see a rich result that features multiple fact checks in Google Search right away.
If you decide to specify multiple ClaimReview items on a single
page, make sure they are all relevant to the main topic of the page. Use one of the following methods:
Create a summary page with multiple summarized fact checks, each with its own ClaimReview
element. Post the full-text version of each fact check on its own page.
Each ClaimReview element on the summary page points to the full-page version
rather than to the summary page.
OR
Create a single page with multiple full-length reviews, each with an HTML anchor. Each
ClaimReview element points to that summary_page.html#anchor.
Structured data type definitions
The following structured data types are required to implement fact checks:
ClaimReview
Claim
Rating
You must include the required properties for your content to be eligible for display as a rich result.
You can also include the recommended properties to add more information about your content,
which could provide a better user experience.
If your organization is interested in implementing or experiencing issues with
ClaimReview,
submit
your contact information. Our team may reach out to you.
ClaimReview
The full definition of ClaimReview is available at
schema.org/ClaimReview.
Required properties
claimReviewed
Text
A short summary of the claim being evaluated. Try to keep this less than 75 characters
to minimize wrapping when displayed on a mobile device.
reviewRating
Rating
The assessment of the claim. This object supports both a numeric and a textual assessment.
The textual value is currently the only value shown in search results.
Different fact-checking projects have a variety of rating schemes which can have subtle differences,
particularly for intermediate values. It is important to document such rating schemes to clarify
the meaning of the numeric ratings. Minimally, there should be a number to text rating system
for all your fact checks that carry numeric scores.
1 = "False"
2 = "Mostly false"
3 = "Half true"
4 = "Mostly true"
5 = "True"
For more information, see Rating.
url
URL
Link to the page hosting the full article of the fact check. If the page has multiple
ClaimReview elements, be sure that the fact check has an HTML anchor, and
this property points to that anchor. Examples: http://example.com/longreview.html or
http://example.com/summarypage.html#fact1
The domain of this URL value must be the same domain as, or a subdomain of, the
page hosting this ClaimReview element. Redirects or shortened URLs (such
as g.co/searchconsole) are not resolved, and so will not work here.
Recommended properties
author
Organization
The publisher of the fact check article, not the publisher of the
claim. The author must be an organization or a person. The
author have at least one of the following properties:
name
Text
Name of the organization that is publishing the fact check.
url
URL
The URL of the publisher of the fact check. This can be a homepage, contact page,
or other appropriate page.
datePublished
DateTime
The date when the fact check was published
itemReviewed
Claim
An object describing the claim being made. For more information, see
Claim.
Backwards compatibility: Upon the initial launch
of fact check, Google Search recommended CreativeWork as the
itemReviewed. Google Search continues to support earlier markup patterns.
Here's an example that shows the original markup style:
<html>
<head>
<title>The world is flat</title>
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
"@context": "https://schema.org",
"@type": "ClaimReview",
"datePublished": "2016-06-22",
"url": "http://example.com/news/science/worldisflat.html",
"itemReviewed":
{
"@type": "CreativeWork",
"author":
{
"@type": "Organization",
"name": "Square World Society",
"sameAs": "https://example.flatworlders.com/we-know-that-the-world-is-flat"
},
"datePublished": "2016-06-20"
},
"claimReviewed": "The world is flat",
"author":
{
"@type": "Organization",
"name": "Example.com science watch"
},
"reviewRating":
{
"@type": "Rating",

"alternateName" : "False"
}
}
</script>
</head>

</html>
Claim
The full definition of Claim is available at
schema.org/Claim.
Recommended properties
appearance
URL or
CreativeWork
A link to, or inline description of, a CreativeWork in which this claim
appears.
author
Organization or
Person
The author of the claim, not the author of the fact check. Don't include
the author property if the claim doesn't have an author. If you add
author, define the following properties:
nameText, required
The publisher of the claim. The publisher can be a person or organization.
sameAs
URL, recommended
Indicates the party that is making the claim, regardless of whether the party
is a Person or
Organization. When multiple publishers
report on the same claim, the appearance property can be repeated. When
multiple parties are making essentially the same claim, the author
property can be repeated.
The URL can be:
The homepage of the organization that is making the claim.
Another definitive URL that provides information about the party that is making
the claim, such as a person or organization's Wikipedia or Wikidata entry.
datePublished
DateTime
The date when the claim was made or entered public discourse (for example, when it became
popular in social networks).
firstAppearance
URL or
CreativeWork
A link to, or inline description of, a CreativeWork in which this specific
claim first appears.
Rating
The full definition of Rating is available at schema.org/Rating.
Required properties
alternateName
Text
The truthfulness rating assigned to ClaimReview.reviewRating, as a human-readible
short word or phrase. This value is displayed
in the fact check in search results. Examples: "True" or
"Mostly true".
If using a longer sentence, be sure that the beginning of the sentence
expresses the meaning, in case the sentence is truncated to fit the display. For example:
"Mostly true in the specifics, although the overall claim is somewhat misleading"
Recommended properties
bestRating
Number
For numeric ratings, the best value possible in the scale from worst to best. Must be greater than
worstRating. Must be able to be evaluated as a number. Example:
4
name
Text
Same as alternateName, and used when alternateName is not
provided, but we recommend that you specify alternateName instead of name.
ratingValue
Number
A numeric rating of this claim, in the range worstRating —
bestRating inclusive. Integer values are recommended but not required. The closer the numeric
rating is to bestRating, the more true it is; the closer this value is to
worstRating, the more false it is. The numeric rating must be able to
be evaluated as a number. Example: 4
worstRating
Number
For numeric ratings, the worst value possible in a scale from worst to best. Must be less than
bestRating. Must be able to be evaluated as a number. Must have a minimum value
of 1. Example: 1
Monitor rich results with Search Console
Search Console is a tool that helps you monitor how your pages perform in Google Search.
You don't have to sign up for Search Console to be included in Google Search results,
but it can help you understand and improve how Google sees your site. We
recommend checking Search Console in the following cases:
After deploying structured data for the first time
After releasing new templates or updating your code
Analyzing traffic periodically
After deploying structured data for the first time
After Google has indexed your pages, look for issues using the relevant
Rich result status report.
Ideally you should see an increase of valid pages, and no increase in errors or warnings. If you find issues
in your structured data:
Fix the errors.
Inspect a live URL to check if the issue persists.
Request validation using the status report.
After releasing new templates or updating your code
When you make significant changes to your website, monitor for increases in structured data errors and warnings.
If you see an increase in errors, perhaps you rolled out a new template that doesn't work, or your site interacts with the existing
template in a new and bad way.
If you see a decrease in valid items (not matched by an increase in errors), perhaps you are
no longer embedding structured data in your pages. Use the
URL Inspection tool to learn what is causing the issue.
Analyzing traffic periodically
Analyze your Google Search traffic using the Performance Report.
The data will show you how often your page appears as a rich result in Search, how often users click on it and what is
the average position you appear on search results. You can also automatically pull these
results with the Search
Console API.
Troubleshooting
Important: Google does not guarantee that features that consume structured data will
show up in search results. For a list of common reasons why Google may not
show your content in a rich result, see the General
Structured Data Guidelines.
If you're having trouble implementing structured data, here are some resources that may help you.
You might have an error in your structured data. Check the
list of structured
data errors.
Troubleshoot
missing rich results / drop in total rich results.
For general questions about crawling and indexing, check the
Webmaster FAQ.
Note: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it
may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
