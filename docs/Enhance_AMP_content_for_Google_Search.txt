Enhance AMP content for Google Search
You can enhance your AMP content for Google Search by creating a basic AMP page, adding structured
data, monitoring your pages, and practicing with codelabs.
Create a basic AMP page
Create your
first AMP page.
Follow the Google Search guidelines for AMP pages.
Make your content discoverable by linking
your pages. For crawling and indexing, Google Search requires that an AMP
page links to a canonical page.
The canonical page can be either a non-AMP version of the page or it can be the AMP page itself.
For more information, see the What's in an
AMP URL? developer blog post.
Ensure that users can experience the same content and complete the same actions on AMP pages as
on the corresponding canonical pages, where possible.
Use the AMP Test Tool to
ensure that your page meets the Google Search requirements for a valid AMP HTML document.
Use the same structured data markup across both the canonical and AMP pages.
Apply common content best practices:
Make sure that your robots.txt
file doesn't block your AMP page. Use the meta robots noindex, block indexing,
and robots meta tags.
Follow the guidelines for hreflang for
language and regional URLs. For AMP specific examples, see Internationalization.
Create an AMP page using a CMS
If you serve your web content through a Content Management System (CMS), you can
use an existing CMS plugin (such as for WordPress, Drupal, or Joomla) or implement
custom functionality in your CMS to generate AMP content. If you intend to
customize your CMS, follow these guidelines in addition to Create a basic AMP page:
Consider how AMP HTML files will fit your site's URL path scheme. If youâ€™re generating an AMP
page in addition to a canonical non-AMP page, we recommend choosing one of the following URL schemes:
http://www.example.com/myarticle/amp
http://www.example.com/myarticle.amp.html
Develop a structured data markup template. Here are some guidelines:
Construct the template based on the requirements for the type of content
you are publishing.
Refer to AMP
Project metadata examples for sample templates for recipes, articles, videos, and reviews.
Optimize for rich mobile search results
Use structured data to enhance the appearance of your page in Google mobile
search results. AMP pages with structured data can appear in rich results in
mobile search, like the Top stories carousel or host carousel.
Implement structured data. For more
information about AMP-supported structured data, see About AMP on Google Search.
Verify that your structured data parses correctly by using the Structured Data
Testing Tool.
Ensure that your logo meets the AMP
logo guidelines. If your logo is missing or not properly formatted, it will
either be displayed poorly or not at all in the Top stories carousel.
Verify your complete AMP for Google Search by using the AMP Test Tool.
Monitor and improve your pages
Periodically check all of your AMP pages by monitoring the following reports:
AMP status report: Catch site
templating and other site-wide implementation issues that can affect large numbers of your AMP
pages.
Rich result status reports:
Identify problems with your structured data and opportunities to provide additional structured
data.
If you need to immediately update the Google AMP Cache to serve the latest
version of your content, refer to Update AMP
Content.
If you need to stop serving your AMP pages from Google Search results, follow Remove AMP from Google Search results.
Practice with Codelabs
Here are some codelabs to practice building AMP pages for Google Search:
Learn how to build AMP pages with the AMP
foundations codelab.
Add features like analytics, video embedding, social media integration, and
image carousels to your AMP pages with the Advanced
concepts codelab.
Build a beautiful,
interactive, and canonical AMP pages codelab that incorporates many AMP
features and extended components.
Use AMP components to build a PWA
experience with the AMP+PWA
codelab.
