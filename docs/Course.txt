Course
Mark up your course lists with structured data so prospective students find you through
Google Search. You can provide details including the course name, who's offering it, and a
short description.
How to add structured data
Structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page
content. If you’re new to structured data, you can learn more about
how structured data works.
Here's an overview of how to build, test, and release structured data. For a step-by-step guide
on how to add structured data to a web page, check out the
structured
data codelab.
Add the required properties. For information about where to put
structured data on the page, watch JSON-LD structured
data: Where to insert on the page.
Follow the guidelines.
Validate your code using the
Rich Results Test.
Deploy a few pages that include your structured data and use the URL Inspection tool to test how Google sees the page. Be sure that your page is
accessible to Google and not blocked by a robots.txt file, the noindex tag, or
login requirements. If the page looks okay, you can
ask Google to
recrawl your URLs.
Note: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it
may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
To keep Google informed of future changes, we recommend that you
submit a
sitemap. You can automate this with the
Search Console Sitemap
API.
Example
Here's an example of a course in JSON-LD:
<html>
<head>
<title>Introduction to Computer Science and Programming</title>
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
"@context": "https://schema.org",
"@type": "Course",
"name": "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming",
"description": "Introductory CS course laying out the basics.",
"provider": {
"@type": "Organization",
"name": "University of Technology - Eureka",
"sameAs": "http://www.ut-eureka.edu"
}
}
</script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Introduction to Computer Science and Programming</title>
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
"@context": "https://schema.org",
"@type": "Course",
"name": "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming",
"description": "Introductory CS course laying out the basics.",
"provider": {

Guidelines
You must follow these guidelines to be eligible to appear in a Course carousel.
Warning: If your site violates one or more of these guidelines, then Google may take manual action against it. Once you have remedied the problem, you can submit your site for reconsideration.

General structured data guidelines
Content guidelines
Only use Course markup for educational content that fits the following definition of a course:
A series or unit of curriculum that contains lectures, lessons, or modules in a particular
subject and/or topic.
A course must have an explicit educational outcome of knowledge and/or
skill in a particular subject and/or topic, and be led by one or more instructors with a roster of students.
A general public event such as “Astronomy Day” is not a course, and a single 2-minute “How
to make a Sandwich Video” is not a course.
Technical guidelines
Each course's name and
provider must be a valid
name and have a valid title. For example, the following naming practices are not valid:
Promotional phrases: "Best school in the world"
Prices in course titles: "Learn ukulele - only $30!"
Using a non-course for a title, such as:
"Make money fast with this class!"
Discounts or purchase opportunties, such as: "Leaders in their fields
share their secrets — 25% off!"

show your content in a rich result, see the General
Structured Data Guidelines.
If you're having trouble implementing structured data, here are some resources that may help you.
You might have an error in your structured data. Check the
