Course
Mark up your course lists with structured data so prospective students find you through
Google Search. You can provide details including the course name, who's offering it, and a
short description.
Example
Here's an example of a course in JSON-LD:
<html>
<head>
<title>Introduction to Computer Science and Programming</title>
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
"@context": "https://schema.org",
"@type": "Course",
"name": "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming",
"description": "Introductory CS course laying out the basics.",
"provider": {
"@type": "Organization",
"name": "University of Technology - Eureka",
"sameAs": "http://www.ut-eureka.edu"
}
}
</script>

General structured data guidelines
Content guidelines
Only use course markup for educational content that fits the following definition of a course:
A series or unit of curriculum that contains lectures, lessons, or modules in a particular
subject and/or topic.
A course must have an explicit educational outcome of knowledge and/or
skill in a particular subject and/or topic, and be led by one or more instructors with a roster of students.
A general public event such as “Astronomy Day” is not a course, and a single 2-minute “How
to make a Sandwich Video” is not a course.
Technical guidelines
Each course's name and
provider must be a valid
name and have a valid title. For example, the following naming practices are not valid:
Promotional phrases: "Best school in the world"
Prices in course titles: "Learn ukulele - only $30!"
Using a non-course for a title, such as:
"Make money fast with this class!"
Discounts or purchase opportunties, such as: "Leaders in their fields
share their secrets — 25% off!"
