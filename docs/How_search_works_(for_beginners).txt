How Search Works (for beginners)
Inclusion in Google's search results is free and easy; you don't even need to submit your
site to Google.
Google is a fully-automated search engine that uses software known as "web crawlers" that
explore the web on a regular basis to find sites to add to our index. In fact, the vast
majority of sites listed in our results aren't manually submitted for inclusion, but are
found and added automatically when our web crawlers crawl the web.
Google search works in essentially three stages:
Crawling: Google searches the web with automated programs called
crawlers, looking for pages that are new or updated. Google stores those page
addresses (or page URLs) in a big list to look at later. We find pages by many
different methods, but the main method is following links from pages that we already know
about.
Indexing: Google visits the pages that it has learned about by
crawling, and tries to analyze what each page is about. Google analyzes the content,
images, and video files in the page, trying to understand what the page is about. This
information is stored in the Google index, a huge database that is stored on many
computers.
Serving search results: When a user performs a Google search, Google
tries to determine the highest quality results. The "best" results have many factors,
including things such as the user's location, language, device (desktop or phone), and
previous queries. For example, searching for "bicycle repair shops" would show different
answers to a user in Paris than it would to a user in Hong Kong. Google doesn't accept
payment to rank pages higher, and ranking is done algorithmically.
If you're interested, here's a little
bit more about how search works.
