Breadcrumb
A breadcrumb trail on a page indicates the page's position in the site hierarchy.
A user can navigate all the way up in the site hierarchy, one level at a time,
by starting from the last breadcrumb in the breadcrumb trail.
As of April 6, 2020, data-vocabulary.org markup will no longer be
eligible for the breadcrumb feature in Google Search. To be eligible after April 6, 2020, you
need to replace data-vocabulary.org markup with schema.org markup. Learn more about
sunsetting support
for data-vocabulary.
Examples
Google Search uses breadcrumb markup in the body of a web page to categorize
the information from the page in search results. Often, as illustrated in
following use cases, users can arrive at a page from very different types of
search queries. While each search may return the same web page, the breadcrumb
categorizes the content within the context of the Google Search query. The page
ancillaryjustice.html might display the following breadcrumb trails
depending upon the search context:
A search query for the book title "Ancillary Justice" may generate the following breadcrumb:
Books ›
Authors ›
Ann Leckie ›
Ancillary Justice
Here's an example in JSON-LD to support that breadcrumb:
<html>
<head>
<title>The title of the page</title>
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
"@context": "https://schema.org",
"@type": "BreadcrumbList",
"itemListElement": [{
"@type": "ListItem",
"position": 1,
"name": "Books",
"item": "https://example.com/books"
},{
"@type": "ListItem",
"position": 2,
"name": "Authors",
"item": "https://example.com/books/authors"
},{
"@type": "ListItem",
"position": 3,
"name": "Ann Leckie",
"item": "https://example.com/books/authors/annleckie"
},{
"@type": "ListItem",
"position": 4,
"name": "Ancillary Justice",
"item": "https://example.com/books/authors/ancillaryjustice"
}]
}
</script>
</head>
<body>
</body>

Guidelines
You must follow these guidelines to be eligible to appear with breadcrumbs in Google Search.
Warning: If Google detects that some of the markup on your pages
may be using techniques that are outside our structured data guidelines, your site may receive
a manual action.

General structured data guidelines
Structured data type definitions
To specify breadcrumbs, define an BreadcrumbList that contains at least two
ListItems. You must include the required properties for your content to be eligible
for display with breadcrumbs.
BreadcrumbList
BreadcrumbList is the
container item that holds all elements in the list. The
full definition of BreadcrumbList is available at
schema.org/BreadcrumbList.
Required properties
itemListElement
BreadcrumbList
An array of breadcrumbs listed in a specific order. Specify each breadcrumb with a
ListItem For example:
{
"@context": "https://schema.org",
"@type": "BreadcrumbList",
"itemListElement": [{
"@type": "ListItem",
"position": 1,
"name": "Books",
"item": "https://example.com/books"
},{
"@type": "ListItem",
"position": 2,
"name": "Authors",
"item": "https://example.com/books/authors"
},{
"@type": "ListItem",
"position": 3,
"name": "Ann Leckie",
"item": "https://example.com/books/authors/annleckie"
}]
}
ListItem
ListItem contains details about an individual item in the list. The full
definition of ListItem is available at
schema.org/ListItem.
Required properties
item
URL or a
subtype of Thing
The URL to the webpage that represents the breadcrumb. There are two ways to specify item:
URL: Specify the URL of the page. For example:
"item": "https://example.com/books"
Thing: Use an id to specify the URL based on the markup format
you're using:
JSON-LD: Use @id to specify the URL.
Microdata: You can use href or itemid
to specify the URL.
RDFa: You can use about, href,
or resource to specify the URL.
If the breadcrumb is the last item in the breadcrumb trail, item is not
required. If item isn't included for the last item, Google uses the URL
of the containing page.
name
Text
The title of the breadcrumb displayed for the user. If you're using a
Thing with a name instead of a URL to specify item, then name is not required.
position
Integer
The position of the breadcrumb in the breadcrumb trail. Position 1 signifies
the beginning of the trail.
