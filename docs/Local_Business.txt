Local Business
When users search for businesses on Google Search or Maps, Search results may
display a prominent Knowledge Graph card with details about a business that matched
the query. When users query for a type of business (for example, "best NYC restaurants"), they
may see a carousel of businesses related to the query. With Local Business structured data, you
can tell Google about your business hours, different departments within a business, reviews for
your business, and more. If you want to help users to make a reservation or place an order
directly in Search results, you can use the Maps Booking API to enable bookings, payments, and other actions.
How to add structured data
Structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page
content. If you're new to structured data, you can learn more about
how structured data works.
Here's an overview of how to build, test, and release structured data. For a step-by-step guide
on how to add structured data to a web page, check out the
structured
data codelab.
Add the required properties. For information about where to put
structured data on the page, watch JSON-LD structured
data: Where to insert on the page.
Follow the guidelines.
Validate your code using the
Rich Results Test.
Deploy a few pages that include your structured data and use the URL Inspection tool to test how Google sees the page. Be sure that your page is
accessible to Google and not blocked by a robots.txt file, the noindex tag, or
login requirements. If the page looks okay, you can
ask Google to
recrawl your URLs.
Note: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it
may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
To keep Google informed of future changes, we recommend that you
submit a
sitemap. You can automate this with the
Search Console Sitemap
API.

Business hours
The following examples demonstrate how to mark up different types of business
hours.
We accept both the official schema.org notation for indicating
dayOfWeek
(canonical URLs for Monday, Tuesday), as well as a
shorter form being discussed in the schema.org community. We expect
to update this documentation to track the
eventual outcome of those discussions, and to continue to accept both
variations for backwards compatibility.
Standard hours
Excluding the validFrom and validThrough properties signify that the hours are valid year-round.This example defines a business that is open weekdays from 9am to 9pm, with
weekend hours from 10am until 11pm.
"openingHoursSpecification": [
{
"@type": "OpeningHoursSpecification",
"dayOfWeek": [
"Monday",
"Tuesday",
"Wednesday",
"Thursday",
"Friday"
],
"opens": "09:00",
"closes": "21:00"
},
{
"@type": "OpeningHoursSpecification",
"dayOfWeek": [
"Saturday",
"Sunday"
],
"opens": "10:00",
"closes": "23:00"
}
]
Late night hours
For hours past midnight, define opening and closing hours using
a single OpeningHoursSpecification property. This example defines hours from Saturday
at 6pm until Sunday at 3am.
"openingHoursSpecification": {
"@type": "OpeningHoursSpecification",
"dayOfWeek": "Saturday",
"opens": "18:00",
"closes": "03:00"
}
All-day hours
To show a business as open 24 hours a day, set the open
property to "00:00" and the closes property to "23:59".To show a business is closed
all day, set both opens and closes properties to "00:00". This example
shows a business open all day Saturday and closed all day Sunday.
"openingHoursSpecification": [
{
"@type": "OpeningHoursSpecification",
"dayOfWeek": "Saturday",
"opens": "00:00",
"closes": "23:59"
},
{
"@type": "OpeningHoursSpecification",
"dayOfWeek": "Sunday",
"opens": "00:00",
"closes": "00:00"
}
]
Seasonal hours
Use both the validFrom and validThrough properties to define seasonal
hours. This example shows a business closed for winter holidays.
"openingHoursSpecification": {
"@type": "OpeningHoursSpecification",
"opens": "00:00",
"closes": "00:00",
"validFrom": "2015-12-23",
"validThrough": "2016-01-05"
}
Multiple departments
For a business with departments, each with its own distinct properties such
as opening hours or telephone numbers, you can mark up the department property
with an element for each department. Define properties that differ
from the main store individually in each respective department element.

Guidelines
You must follow these guidelines to be eligible to appear in Local Business rich results.
Warning: If your site violates one or more of these guidelines,

Restaurant,
DaySpa,
HealthClub, and so on.

If you have multiple restaurants listed on your site, and you want them to be eligible for a
host carousel, add the Carousel object. In addition to the standard Carousel properties, define the following properties in your Carousel object. While carousel properties
aren't required, you must add the following properties if you want your restaurant list to be
