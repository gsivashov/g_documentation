Adding Article structured data to your news, blog, and sports
article page can enhance your appearance in Google Search results. Your page may be eligible
for different features depending on how you code your page:
AMP with structured data: AMP
pages with structured data can appear in the Top stories carousel, host carousel of rich
results, Visual stories, and rich results in mobile Search results. These results can include
images, page logos, and other interesting search result features.
Non-AMP web page with structured data: Non-AMP
pages that include Article structured data can help Google
understand more about the web page and show better headline text, images, and date published
for the article in Article rich results.
By structuring your content according to this guide,
your content may be automatically turned into an Action on the Google Assistant.
Examples
Here's an example of JSON-LD code on an AMP page with Article structured data.

Implementation
AMP with structured data
AMP pages that have structured data can appear in a carousel of stories in search results.
Without structured data, AMP pages may only appear as standard blue links in Google Search results.
For more information about AMP in search results, see
About AMP on Google Search.
To create an AMP page with structured data:
Follow the AMP Project
specifications.
Follow the additional page guidelines to ensure that
Google can crawl your page.
Add a structured data element describing the article on the page.
If you have duplicate pages for the same content, we recommend placing the
same structured data on all page duplicates, not just on the canonical page. For more
information on placement, see the Structured Data
General Guidelines.
Test your structured data using the Rich Results Test.
Non-AMP page with structured data
When you add Article structured data to a non-AMP page, you can
better suggest the right headline, date published, and image that Google should show in Search results.
To add structured data to your non-AMP article page:
Add a structured data element to your page, describing the
article on the page.
Read the guidelines to ensure that
Google can crawl your page.
Test your structured data using the Rich Results Test.
Guidelines
You must follow these guidelines to enable structured data to be eligible for inclusion in Google Search results.
Warning: If your site violates one or more of these guidelines,
then Google may take
manual action against it.
Once you have remedied the problem, you can submit your site for
reconsideration.
Webmaster guidelines
General structured data guidelines
Technical guidelines
AMP logo guidelines (if applicable)
AMP story metadata requirements (if applicable)
Technical guidelines
If you offer subscription-based access to your website content, or if users must register
for access, consider adding structured data for
subscription and paywalled content.
For multi-part content, make sure that the rel=canonical points at either
each individual page or a "view-all" page (and not to page 1 of a multi-part series). Learn
more about canonicalization.
AMP logo guidelines
Note: These logo guidelines apply to the Article structured
data placed on individual AMP pages. For guidelines about the Logo markup that
apply to the actual logo of a site, see the
Logo markup documentation.
The following guidelines apply to logos for all AMP pages, including AMP stories.
The file format must be supported by Google Images.
Don't use animation.
The graphic part of the logo should be legible on the background color.
The following guidelines apply to logos used for general AMP pages, not AMP stories. There are different logo requirements for AMP stories.
The logo must be a rectangle, not a square.
The logo should fit in a 60x600px rectangle, and either be exactly 60px high (preferred),
or exactly 600px wide. For example, 450x45px would not be acceptable, even though it fits
within the 600x60px rectangle.
Publishers should use only one logo per brand that is consistent across general AMP pages.
Use full wordmark or full logo; not an icon.
The text in word-based logos should be at most 48px tall and centered vertically within
the 60px image height. Add additional space to pad the height to 60px.
Logos with a solid background should include 6px minimum padding around the graphic.
Structured data type definitions
The following section describes the property requirements for Article
structured data. AMP and non-AMP pages have different property requirements and
recommendations:
For AMP pages: You must include the required properties for your content
to be eligible for display as a rich result. You can also include the recommended properties
to add more information about your content, which could provide a better user experience.
For non-AMP pages: To help Google understand your page better, include
the recommended properties for non-AMP pages.
Article objects
Article objects must be based on one of the following
schema.org types: Article,
NewsArticle, BlogPosting.
AMP
The following properties apply to AMP pages.
Required properties
author
Person or Organization
The author of the article.
author.name
Text
The name of the author.
datePublished
DateTime
The date and time the article was first published, in ISO 8601 format.
Best practices:
The date shouldn't change over time.
We recommend including the hour information in addition to the day in the timestamp.
The value for dateModified should be more recent than the value for datePublished.
headline
Text
The headline of the article. Headlines should not exceed 110 characters. For AMP stories, the headline should match the text in the first cover page in the AMP Story.
image
Repeated property of ImageObject or URL
The URL to an image that is representative of the article or AMP story.
Due to format differences in search results, the following image guidelines only apply to general AMP pages, not AMP stories. AMP stories have different requirements for images.
Only a marked-up image that directly belongs to the article should be specified.
Images should be at least 1200 pixels wide.
Every page must contain at least one image (whether or not you include markup). Google will pick
the best image to display in Search results based on the aspect ratio and resolution.
Image URLs must be crawlable and indexable.
Images must represent the marked up content.
The file format must be supported by Google Images.
For best results, provide multiple high-resolution images (minimum of 800,000 pixels when multiplying width and
height) with the following aspect ratios: 16x9, 4x3, and 1x1.
For example:
{
"@context": "https://schema.org",
"@type": "NewsArticle",
"image": [
"https://example.com/photos/1x1/photo.jpg",
"https://example.com/photos/4x3/photo.jpg",
"https://example.com/photos/16x9/photo.jpg"
]
}
publisher
Organization

publisher.logo
ImageObject
The logo of the publisher. See the AMP logo guidelines for details.
publisher.logo.url
URL
The URL of the logo.
publisher.name
Text
The name of the publisher.
Recommended properties
dateModified

The date and time the article was most recently modified, in ISO 8601 format.
mainEntityOfPage
URL
The canonical URL of the article page. Specify mainEntityOfPage when the
article is the primary topic of the article page.

Recommended properties
dateModified
DateTime
The date and time the article was most recently modified, in ISO 8601 format.
Add the dateModified property if you want to provide more accurate date information to Google.
The Rich Results Test doesn't show a warning for this property,
as it's only recommended if you decide that it's applicable to your site.
datePublished
DateTime
The date and time the article was first published, in
ISO 8601 format.
Add the datePublished property if you want to provide more
accurate date information to Google. The
Rich Results Test doesn't show a

headline
Text
The headline of the article. Headlines should not exceed 110 characters.
image
Repeated ImageObject or URL
The URL to an image that is representative of the article. Only a marked-up image that directly
belongs to the article should be specified. Images should be at least 696 pixels wide.

]
}
Troubleshooting
Important: Google does not guarantee that features that consume structured data will
show up in search results. For a list of common reasons why Google may not
show your content in a rich result, see the General
Structured Data Guidelines.
If you're having trouble implementing structured data, here are some resources that may help you.
You might have an error in your structured data. Check the
list of structured
data errors.
Troubleshoot
missing rich results / drop in total rich results.
For general questions about crawling and indexing, check the
Webmaster FAQ.
Note: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it
may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
