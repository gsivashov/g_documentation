Move a site with no URL changes3. Monitor trafficOnce the site move starts, be ready to address any problemsNext: 4. Shut down old hostingHere are three things you can do to make sure your move is going smoothly:
Keep an eye on the server logs on both new and old servers.
As DNS setting propagates and the site traffic moves, you’ll notice a drop in traffic logged on the old servers and a corresponding increase in traffic on the new servers.
Use different public DNS checking tools.
Check that different ISPs around the world are updating to your new DNS settings correctly.
Monitor crawling.
Monitor the Index coverage graphs in Search Console.
Let Googlebot decide.
Rather than manually setting a maximum crawl rate in Search Console, keep the setting at Let Googlebot decide. This way, settings designed only for the old system will not interfere with the requirements of your new system.
A note about Googlebot’s crawl rate
It’s normal to see a temporary drop in Googlebot’s crawl rate immediately after the launch, followed by a steady increase over the next few weeks, potentially to rates that may be higher than from before the move.
This fluctuation occurs because we determine crawl rate for a site based on many signals, and these signals change when your hosting changes. As long as Googlebot does not encounter any serious problems or slowdowns when accessing your new serving infrastructure, it will try to crawl your site as fast as necessary and possible.
