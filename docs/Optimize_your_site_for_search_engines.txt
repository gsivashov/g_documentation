Optimize your site for search engines
Here are a few simple ideas that can help Google understand your site, and help the right people find it.
Google doesn't accept payment to rank a website higher, or rank websites higher if they advertise on Google. If anyone tells you otherwise, they're wrong.
Be descriptive: Use accurate, descriptive titles for your pages. We recommend putting different topics, products, or services on different pages, one topic (or closely related set of items) per page.
Be complete: Mention everything that you have to offer. Google is smart, but we can't guess what you don't tell us.
Be topical: Update your content to account for seasons, trends, or new offerings. For example, if you run an ice cream store that also sells hot chocolate, be sure to feature your ice cream in the summer, and your hot chocolate (or coffee, or sandwiches) prominently in the winter, when people won't be looking for ice cream stores. If a new trend starts for kiwi ice cream and you have it in your store, feature it prominently.
Keep your site up to date: If you haven't updated your site since 1925, it's time to remove the references to Calvin Coolidge in your current events blog.
Use text: Don't put your site content or page titles only in images, video, animations, or other non-text formats that Google doesn't understand as easily as text. If you use a graphic for your site name, include the name in the page text as well.
Get referrals: Have your site mentioned in useful places online. See if you can get into your local online news sites, or in any other appropriate resources.
Want your site to do better, but don't have the time? If you think your site needs more help than you can provide, consider hiring a professional.
