Book
Book actions make Google Search an entry point for discovering books and authors, enabling Search
users to quickly buy the books that they find directly from Search results. As a provider of e-books,
you can provide a feed of data to Google using the structured data schema below.
To ensure robust
coverage and better serve our users, this feature is currently limited to
book providers that have broad book availability. If you would like to participate, register your
interest in our form. Indicating interest in this feature does not guarantee participation.
Examples
The userâ€™s query can indicate an intent to find a book, such as
a book title, like The Catcher in the Rye, or the books of J.D. Salinger.
For
relevant queries, we might show a Knowledge
Graph card for the book. Read more about managing your Knowledge Graph data. Read actions, which are incorporated into the cards, display
options for acquiring the book. Through links you provide, read actions
send users directly from the Knowledge Graph card to a book page on your
site or app.

supports the acquisition of the book.
Read action links must point to a page where users can acquire the content. Read action

details, such as a search results page or product summary page.
