Mobile Recharge Early Adopters Program
Mobile Recharge on Search enables people to easily search for and compare offers and discounts
for prepaid mobile recharge plans on their Android device. People can also use the mobile wallet
or payment service of their choice to complete the checkout. This feature is only available in
English in India.
How it works
When a user sends a query that's related to recharge, for example "prepaid mobile recharge",
this triggers a Search result that contains key fields such as phone number, operator, and circle.
Once a user submits the form, they can tap Browse plans to view available
prepaid plans.
After a user chooses a plan, they are given a list of valid offers from all the providers who
can fulfill the selected plan. The user can then tap a provider to complete checkout through
the provider’s app or mobile site.
When the user completes the transaction, the provider’s confirmation page includes a
Back to Google button that directs the user back to Search. On the
confirmation page, users are also given access to customer support information about the
recharge.
Eligibility requirements
To be eligible for Mobile Recharge, you must be a service provider or a mobile recharge plans
aggregator in India that providers offers on mobile phone plans.
