Carousel
A carousel is a list-like rich result that people can swipe through on mobile devices. It
displays multiple cards from the same site (also known as a host carousel). To enable a
carousel for your site, add Carousel structured data in combination with one of the following
supported content types:
Course
Movie
Recipe
Restaurant
Here's how carousels can look in Google Search when you add Carousel markup in combination
with a supported content type:
Note: There are other carousel-like features on Google
Search, like Top stories, that feature cards from multiple sites. You can't control those
types of carousels with Carousel markup.
Add structured data
Structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page
content. If youâ€™re new to structured data, you can learn more about
how structured data works.
Here's an overview of how to add structured data to your site:
Decide which page will contain the Carousel structured data. There are two options:
Summary page and multiple detail pages: The summary page has a short
description of each item in the list, and each description points to a separate detail page
that is focused entirely on one item. For example, a summary page that lists the best cookie
recipes, and each description links out to the full recipe for each cookie.
A single, all-in-one-page list: A single page that contains all
list information, including full text of each item. For example, a list of the top movies in
2020, all contained on one page.
Add the required properties. For information about where to put
structured data on the page, watch JSON-LD structured
data: Where to insert on the page.
Add the required and recommended properties for the specific content type that the Carousel is about:
Course
Movie
Recipe
Restaurant
Follow the guidelines.
Summary page and multiple detail pages
The summary page has a short description of each item in the list. Each
description points to a separate details page that is focused entirely on one
item.
Summary page
The summary page defines an ItemList, where each ListItem has
only three properties: @type (set to "ListItem"),
position (the position in the list), and url (the URL of a page with
full details about that item).
Here's an example of what the summary page looks like:
<html>
<head>
<title>Best cookie recipes</title>
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
"@context":"https://schema.org",
"@type":"ItemList",

Details page
The details page defines the specific structured data type that the Carousel is about. For example,
if the summary page is about the best cookie recipes, each detail page would contain
Recipe structured data for a specific recipe.
Here's an example of what the detail pages look like:

Guidelines
In addition to the General structured data
guidelines, the following guidelines apply to Carousel structured data:
All items in the list must be of the same type. For example, if a list is about recipes,
only include Recipe items. Don't mix different types.
Make sure that the Carousel structured data is complete and contains all the items that are
listed on the page.
The text visible to the user must be similar to the information contained in the structured
data on the page.
Items shown in list format will be shown in the order specified by the position
property.
Validate and deploy structured data
Validate your code using the
Rich Results Test.
For a summary page, there are some things you need to verify yourself:
Check that itemListElement contains two or more ListItem elements.
Make sure that all of the ListItem elements are the same type (for example, they are all about recipes).
Validate each URL that's mentioned in the list using the Rich Results Test. Each page in the list
must contain valid structured data, per the documentation for the supported content
type that the list is about:
Recipe,
Course,
Restaurant,
Movie.
Deploy a few pages that include your structured data and use the
URL
Inspection tool to test how Google sees the page. Be sure that your page is
accessible to Google and not blocked by a robots.txt file, the noindex tag, or
login requirements. If the page looks okay, you can
ask Google to
recrawl your URLs.
Note: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it
may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
To keep Google informed of future changes, we recommend that you
submit a
sitemap. You can automate this with the
Search Console Sitemap
API.
Structured data type definitions
To specify a list, define an ItemList that contains at least two
ListItems. You must include the required properties for your content to be eligible
for display as a rich result.
ItemList
ItemList is the
container item that holds all elements in the list. If used on a
summary page, all URLs in the list must point to different pages on the same domain. If used on
an all-in-one-page list, all URLs must point to an anchor on the page that's hosting the list
structured data.
The full definition of ItemList is
available at schema.org/ItemList.
Required properties
itemListElement
ListItem
List of items. All items must be of the same type. See
ListItem for details.
ListItem
ListItem contains details about an individual item in the list.
If this is a summary page, include only
the type, position, and url properties in the ListItem.
If this is an all-in-one-page list, include all the additional schema.org
properties for the data type that it describes. The supported data types are:
Course
Movie
Recipe
Restaurant
The full definition of ListItem is available at
schema.org/ListItem.
Summary pages
The following properties apply to summary pages:
Required properties
position
Integer
The item's position in the carousel. This is a 1-based number.
url
URL
The canonical URL of the item detail page. All URLs in the list must be unique, but live
on the same domain (the same domain or sub/super domain as the current page).
All-in-one pages
The following properties apply to all-in-one pages:
Required properties
item
Thing
An individual thing in a list. Populate this object with the following values, plus all the
properties of the specific structured data type being described:
item.name
item.url
Any other properties required for this data type, as described in schema.org and the rules
described in the documents for your content type:
Course
Movie
Recipe
Restaurant
Example: For a recipe, you would provide prepTime and image
properties.
item.name
Text
The string name of the item. The item.name is displayed as the title of an
individual item in the carousel. HTML formatting is ignored.
item.url
URL
The fully-qualified URL and page anchor to this item on the page. The URL must be
the current page, and you must include an HTML anchor (<a> tag or
name or id value) in your page near the user-visible text.
Example: https://example.org/recipes/pies#apple_pie.
position
Integer
The item's position in the carousel. This is a 1-based number.
Troubleshooting
Important: Google does not guarantee that features that consume structured data will
show up in search results. For a list of common reasons why Google may not
show your content in a rich result, see the General
Structured Data Guidelines.
If you're having trouble implementing structured data, here are some resources that may help you.
You might have an error in your structured data. Check the
list of structured
data errors.
Troubleshoot
missing rich results / drop in total rich results.
For general questions about crawling and indexing, check the
Webmaster FAQ.
Note: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it
may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
Ask a question in the Webmaster
Office Hours.
Post a question in the Webmaster
forum.
