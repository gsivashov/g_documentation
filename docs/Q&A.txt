Q&A
Does your site publish FAQ content, with no way for users to submit
alternative answers? Use
FAQ structured data instead.
Q&A pages are web pages that contain data in a question and answer format, which is one question
followed by its answers. For content that represents a question and its
answers, you can mark up your data with the
schema.org QAPage, Question, and Answer types.
Properly marked up pages are eligible to have a rich result displayed on the search results
page. This rich treatment helps your site reach the right users on Search.
Here's an example of a result you might see for the user query "How do I remove a cable that is
stuck in a USB port?" if the page has been marked up to answer that question:
In addition to enabling your content for the rich result treatment shown above, marking up
your Q&A page helps Google generate a better
snippet for your page.
In the example above, the content from the answers may appear in the basic result if the rich
result is not shown.
How to add structured data
Structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page
content. If youâ€™re new to structured data, you can learn more about
how structured data works.
Here's an overview of how to build, test, and release structured data. For a step-by-step guide
on how to add structured data to a web page, check out the
structured
data codelab.
Add the required properties. For information about where to put
structured data on the page, watch JSON-LD structured
data: Where to insert on the page.
Follow the guidelines.
Validate your code using the
Rich Results Test.
Deploy a few pages that include your structured data and use the URL Inspection tool to test how Google sees the page. Be sure that your page is
accessible to Google and not blocked by a robots.txt file, the noindex tag, or
login requirements. If the page looks okay, you can
ask Google to
recrawl your URLs.
Note: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it
may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
To keep Google informed of future changes, we recommend that you
submit a
sitemap. You can automate this with the
Search Console Sitemap
API.

Guidelines
For your Q&A page to be eligible for this rich treatment, you must follow
these guidelines:
General structured data guidelines
Webmaster guidelines
Content Guidelines
Content guidelines
Only use the QAPage markup if your page has information in a question and answer format, which is
one question followed by its answers.
Users must be able to submit answers to the question. Don't use QAPage markup for
content that has only one answer for a given question with no way for users to add alternative
answers; instead, use FAQPage. Here
are some examples:
Valid use cases:
A forum page where users can submit answers to a single question
A product support page where users can submit answers to a single question
Invalid use cases:
An FAQ page written by the site itself with no way for users to submit alternative answers
A product page where users can submit multiple questions and answers on a single page
A how-to guide that answers a question
A blog post that answers a question
An essay that answers a question
Don't apply QAPage markup to all pages on a site or forum if not all the content is eligible.
For example, a forum may have lots of questions posted, which are individually elgible for the markup. However,
if the forum also has pages that are not questions, those pages are not eligible.
Don't use QAPage markup for FAQ pages or pages where there are multiple questions
per page. QAPage markup is for pages where the focus of the page is a single question
and its answers.
Donâ€™t use QAPage markup for advertising purposes.
Make sure each Question includes the entire text of the question and
make sure each Answer includes the entire text of the answer.
Answer markup is for answers to the question, not for comments on the question or
comments on other answers. Don't mark up non-answer comments as an Answer.
Question and answer content may not be displayed as a rich result if it contains any of the
following types of content: obscene, profane, sexually explicit, graphically violent,
promotion of dangerous or illegal activities, or hateful or harassing language.
Structured data type definitions
This section describes the structured data types related to QAPage.
You must include the required properties for your content to be eligible for display as a rich result. You can also
include the recommended properties to add more information to your structured data, which could
provide a better user experience.
You can use Googleâ€™s Rich Results Test to
validate and preview your structured data.
QAPage
The QAPage type indicates that the
page is focused on a specific question and its answer(s). We will only use Question
structured data from pages with QAPage markup. There should only be one
QAPage type definition per page.
The full definition of QAPage is available at https://schema.org/QAPage.
The following table describes the properties of the QAPage type that are used by Google Search.
Required properties
mainEntity
Question
The Question for this page must be nested under the
mainEntity property of the QAPage item.
Question
The Question type defines the question that this page answers, and includes
the answers, if any, to that question. Exactly one Question type is expected on the
page, nested under the mainEntity property of the schema.org/QAPage. There
should only be one Question type definition per page.
The full definition of Question is available at https://schema.org/Question.
If your site doesn't support a recommended property, omit that property from your
structured data.
Required properties
answerCount
Integer
The total number of answers to the question. For example, if there are 15 answers, but only the first 10 are
marked up due to pagination, this value would be 15. This may also be 0 for questions with no answers.
Either acceptedAnswer or suggestedAnswer
Answer
To be eligible for the rich result, a question must have at least one answer â€“ either an
acceptedAnswer or a suggestedAnswer. However, questions may not
have answers when they are first posted. For questions without answers, set
the answerCount property to 0. Questions without answers aren't eligible for
the rich result.
acceptedAnswer
Answer
A top answer to the question. There can be zero or more of these per question. This should
represent answers that are accepted in some way on your site. For example, accepted as a
top answer by question asker, a moderator, or a voting system. Other forms of sorting answers,
such as most-recent, should not be used to identify top answers.
suggestedAnswer
Answer
One possible answer, but not accepted as a top answer (acceptedAnswer).
There can be zero or more of these per Question.
name
Text
The full text of the short form of the question. For example, "How many teaspoons in a cup?".
Recommended properties
author
Person or
Organization
The author of the question.
dateCreated
Date or DateTime
The date at which the question was added to the page, in ISO-8601 format.
text
Text
The full text of the long form of the question. For example, "Iâ€™m cooking, and I need to know how many
teaspoons are in a cup. How many teaspoons are in 1 cup?"
upvoteCount
Integer
The total number of votes that this question has received. If the page supports upvotes and
downvotes, then set the upvoteCount value to a single aggregate value that represents both upvotes and downvotes.
For example, if there are 5 upvotes and 2 downvotes, the aggregate value used for upvoteCount is 3. If there
are 5 upvotes and downvotes are not supported, then the value for upvoteCount is 5.
Answer
The Answer type defines the suggested and accepted answers to the
Question on this page. Define Answers inside the Question,
as values for the suggestedAnswer and acceptedAnswer properties.
The following table describes the properties of the Answer type that is used within a
Question.
The full definition of Answer is available at
https://schema.org/Answer.
If your site doesn't support a recommended property, omit that property from
your structured data.
Required properties
text
Text
The full text of the answer. If only a portion is marked up, your
content may not be shown and Google cannot determine the best text to display.
Recommended properties
author
Person or
Organization
The author of the answer.
dateCreated
Date or DateTime
The date at which the answer was added to the page, in ISO-8601 format.
upvoteCount
Integer
The total number of votes that this answer has received. If the page supports upvotes and
downvotes, then set the upvoteCount value to a single aggregate value that represents both upvotes and downvotes.
For example, if there are 5 upvotes and 2 downvotes, the aggregate value used for upvoteCount is 3. If there
are 5 upvotes and downvotes are not supported, then the value for upvoteCount is 5.
url
URL
A URL that links directly to this answer. For example: https://www.examplesite.com/question#answer1
It is strongly recommended to provide a URL for each answer because
it improves the user experience when the user clicks through to your site.
Monitor rich results with Search Console
Search Console is a tool that helps you monitor how your pages perform in Google Search.
You don't have to sign up for Search Console to be included in Google Search results,
but it can help you understand and improve how Google sees your site. We
recommend checking Search Console in the following cases:
After deploying structured data for the first time
After releasing new templates or updating your code
Analyzing traffic periodically
After deploying structured data for the first time
After Google has indexed your pages, look for issues using the relevant
Rich result status report.
Ideally you should see an increase of valid pages, and no increase in errors or warnings. If you find issues
in your structured data:
Fix the errors.
Inspect a live URL to check if the issue persists.
Request validation using the status report.
After releasing new templates or updating your code
When you make significant changes to your website, monitor for increases in structured data errors and warnings.
If you see an increase in errors, perhaps you rolled out a new template that doesn't work, or your site interacts with the existing
template in a new and bad way.
If you see a decrease in valid items (not matched by an increase in errors), perhaps you are
no longer embedding structured data in your pages. Use the
URL Inspection tool to learn what is causing the issue.
Analyzing traffic periodically
Analyze your Google Search traffic using the Performance Report.
The data will show you how often your page appears as a rich result in Search, how often users click on it and what is
the average position you appear on search results. You can also automatically pull these
results with the Search
Console API.
Troubleshooting
Important: Google does not guarantee that features that consume structured data will
show up in search results. For a list of common reasons why Google may not
show your content in a rich result, see the General
Structured Data Guidelines.
If you're having trouble implementing structured data, here are some resources that may help you.
You might have an error in your structured data. Check the
list of structured
data errors.
Troubleshoot
missing rich results / drop in total rich results.
For general questions about crawling and indexing, check the
Webmaster FAQ.
Note: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it
may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
Ask a question in the Webmaster
Office Hours.
Post a question in the Webmaster
forum.
