Indexing API Errors
This document identifies some of the error codes and messages that Google APIs return. Specifically, the errors listed here are in the global, or default, domain for Google APIs. Many APIs also define their own domains, which identify API-specific errors that are not in the global domain. For those errors, the value of the domain property in the JSON response will be an API-specific value, such as youtube.parameter.
This page lists errors by their HTTP status codes as defined in RFC 7231.
The sample JSON response below demonstrates how a global error is communicated:
{
"error": {
"errors": [
{
"domain": "global",
"reason": "invalidParameter",
"message": "Invalid string value: 'asdf'. Allowed values: [mostpopular]",
"locationType": "parameter",
"location": "chart"
}
],
"code": 400,
"message": "Invalid string value: 'asdf'. Allowed values: [mostpopular]"
}
}
