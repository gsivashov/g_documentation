Refine web searchesYou can use symbols or words in your search to make your search results more precise.
Google Search usually ignores punctuation that isn’t part of a search operator.
Don’t put spaces between the symbol or word and your search term. A search for site:nytimes.com will work, but site: nytimes.com won’t.

Go to Advanced Image Search.
Use filters like region or file type to narrow your results.

Search for an exact image size
Right after the word you're looking for, add the text imagesize:widthxheight. Make sure to add the dimensions in pixels.
