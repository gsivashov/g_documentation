Validate AMP content for Google Search
After you've created AMP content, here are
some ways to validate your AMP content for Google Search:
Use the AMP Test Tool to
ensure that your AMP content is valid for Google Search.
For applicable AMP content types, use the Rich Results Test to verify that your structured data parses properly.
Use the AMP status report
to monitor the performance of all AMP pages on your site.
Fix common AMP errors
If your AMP page doesn't appear in Google Search, try the following steps:
Note: It may take time for Google to index your AMP content.
If Google has indexed your content and you need to immediately update the Google AMP Cache to serve
the latest version
of your content, update the Google AMP
Cache.
Make your page
discoverable by linking your pages.
Did you add rel="amphtml" to the canonical page?
Did you add rel="amphtml" to other non-AMP pages (for example, mobile)?
Did you add rel="canonical" to the AMP page?
Follow the Google Search
guidelines for AMP pages.
Make your AMP content accessible to Googlebot:
Edit your site's robots.txt to allow Googlebot to crawl the canonical page, AMP page, and
links in the structured data (if applicable).
Remove all robots meta tags and X-Robots-Tag HTTP headers from your
canonical and AMP content. For more information, see Robots meta tag and X-Robots-Tag HTTP header specifications.
Ensure that your structured data follows the structured data guidelines for
your page and feature type. For more information about structured data
requirements for AMP, see About AMP on Google Search.
If your AMP page still isn't appearing in Google Search after completing the
above steps, here are some additional reasons:
Certain Google Search features might not be available in your country.
Your site might not be indexed yet. For more information about crawling and indexing, see the Webmaster
FAQ.
