Choose a mobile configuration
Let's make sure that your site shows up in search results. Here you can learn how to
configure your site for multiple devices and help search engines understand your
site.
3 ways to implement your mobile website
There are three main techniques for implementing a website that can handle view
screens of all types and sizes. Here's a chart comparing the three methods:
Configuration
Does my URL stay the same?
Does my HTML stay the same?
Responsive Web Design
Dynamic Serving
Separate URLs
Responsive Web Design: Serves the same HTML code on the same URL
regardless of the users' device (for example, desktop, tablet, mobile, non-visual browser),
but can render the display differently based on the screen
size. Google recommends Responsive Web Design because it's the easiest design pattern to implement and maintain.
Dynamic serving: Uses the same URL regardless of device, but generates
a different version of HTML for different device types based on what the
server knows about the user's browser.
Separate URLs: Serves different code to each device, and on separate
URLs. This configuration tries to detect the users' device, then redirects to
the appropriate page using HTTP redirects along with the Vary HTTP header.
Google does not favor any particular URL format as long as the page(s) and all page assets are accessible to all Googlebot user-agents.

The key points for going mobile
As we discuss later, there are different configurations you can choose to
make your site mobile-friendly. However, there are key points that you should
take note of regardless of which configuration you choose to set up.
Signal to Google when a page is formatted for mobile (or has an equivalent
page that's formatted for mobile). This helps Google accurately serve mobile
searchers your content in search results.
Keep resources crawlable. Don't use robots.txt to block search engines from
accessing critical files on your site that help render the page (including ads).
If Googlebot doesn't have access to a page's resources, such as CSS,
JavaScript, or images, we may not detect that it's built to display and work
well on a mobile browser. In other words, we may not detect that the page is
"mobile-friendly," and therefore not properly serve it to mobile searchers.
Avoid common mistakes that frustrate mobile visitors, such as
featuring unplayable videos (for example, Flash video as the page's significant
content). Mobile pages that provide a poor searcher experience can be
demoted in rankings or displayed with a warning in mobile search results.

Understand the difference between devices
Mobile: In this document, "mobile" or mobile devices refers to smartphones, such
as devices running Android, iPhone, or Windows Phone. Mobile browsers are similar
to desktop browsers in that they can render a broad set of the HTML5
specification, although their screen size is smaller and in almost all cases
their default orientation is vertical.
Tablets: We consider tablets as devices in their own class. When we refer to
mobile devices, we generally aren't referring to tablets. Tablets
tend to have larger screens, which means that, unless you offer tablet-optimized
content, you can assume that users expect to see your site as it would look on a
desktop browser rather than on a smartphone browser.
Multimedia phones: These are phones with browsers that are able to render
pages coded to meet XHTML standards, support HTML5 Markup, JavaScript/ECMAscript
but might not support some of the extension APIs in the HTML5 standard. This
generally describes the browser in most 3G-ready phones that are not smartphones.
Feature phones: On these phones, browsers lack the capability to render
normal desktop webpages coded using standard HTML. This includes browsers that
render only cHTML (iMode), WML, and XHTML-MP.
Note: Our recommendations are geared toward smartphones, but we encourage multimedia and feature phones site owners to follow the same advice where they feel appropriate.
