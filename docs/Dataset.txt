Dataset
Datasets are easier to find when you provide supporting information such as their name, description, creator and distribution formats
as structured data. Google's approach to dataset discovery
makes use of schema.org and other metadata standards that can be added to pages that describe datasets. The purpose of this markup is to
improve discovery of datasets from fields such as life sciences, social sciences, machine
learning, civic and government data, and more. You can find datasets by using the
Dataset Search tool.
Here are some examples of what can qualify as a dataset:
A table or a CSV file with some data
An organized collection of tables
A file in a proprietary format that contains data
A collection of files that together constitute some meaningful dataset
A structured object with data in some other format that you might want to load into a
special tool for processing
Images capturing data
Files relating to machine learning, such as trained parameters or neural network structure definitions
Anything that looks like a dataset to you
How to add structured data
Structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page
content. If youâ€™re new to structured data, you can learn more about
how structured data works.
Here's an overview of how to build, test, and release structured data. For a step-by-step guide
on how to add structured data to a web page, check out the
structured
data codelab.
Add the required properties. For information about where to put
structured data on the page, watch JSON-LD structured
data: Where to insert on the page.
Follow the guidelines.
Validate your code using the
Rich Results Test.
Deploy a few pages that include your structured data and use the URL Inspection tool to test how Google sees the page. Be sure that your page is
accessible to Google and not blocked by a robots.txt file, the noindex tag, or
login requirements. If the page looks okay, you can
ask Google to
recrawl your URLs.
Note: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it
may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
To keep Google informed of future changes, we recommend that you
submit a
sitemap. You can automate this with the
Search Console Sitemap
API.
Our approach to dataset discovery
We can understand structured data in Web pages about datasets, using either schema.org Dataset markup, or equivalent
structures represented in W3C's
Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) format. We also are exploring
experimental support for structured data based on W3C CSVW, and expect to evolve and adapt our approach as best practices for dataset description emerge. For more information about our
approach to dataset discovery, see
Making it easier to discover datasets.
Examples
Here's an example for datasets using JSON-LD and schema.org syntax (preferred) in the
Rich Results Test. The same schema.org vocabulary can also be used in RDFa 1.1 or Microdata syntaxes.
You can also use the W3C DCAT vocabulary to describe the metadata. The following example is based on a
real-world
dataset description.
JSON-LD
Here's an example of a dataset in JSON-LD:

Guidelines
Sites should follow the structured data
guidelines. In addition to the structured data guidelines, we recommend the following
sitemap and source and provenance
best practices listed below.
Sitemap best practices
Use a sitemap file to help
Google find your URLs. Using sitemap files and sameAs markup helps document how
dataset descriptions are published throughout your site.
If you have a dataset repository, you likely have at least two types of pages: the canonical
("landing") pages for each dataset and pages that list multiple datasets (for example, search
results, or some subset of datasets). We recommend that you add structured data about a dataset to
the canonical pages. Use the sameAs
property to link to the canonical page if you add structured data to multiple copies of the
dataset, such as listings in search results pages.
Google doesn't need every mention of the same dataset to be explicitly marked
up, but if you do so for other reasons, we strongly encourage the use of
sameAs.
Source and provenance best practices
It is common for open datasets to be republished, aggregated, and to be based on other datasets.
This is an initial outline of our approach to representing situations in which a dataset is a copy
of, or otherwise based upon, another dataset.
Use the sameAs
property to indicate the most canonical URLs for the original in cases when the dataset or
description is a simple republication of materials published elsewhere. The value of
sameAs needs to
unambiguously indicate the dataset's identity - in other words two different datasets should
not use the same URL as
sameAs value.
Use the isBasedOn property
in cases where the republished dataset (including its metadata) has been changed
significantly.
When a dataset derives from or aggregates several originals, use the
isBasedOn property.
Use the identifier
property to attach any relevant Digital Object identifiers (DOIs) or
Compact Identifiers. If
the dataset has more than one identifier, repeat the identifier property. If
using JSON-LD, this is represented using JSON list syntax.
We hope to improve our recommendations based on feedback, in particular around the description of
provenance, versioning, and the dates associated with time series publication. Please join in
community discussions.
Textual property recommendations
We recommend limiting all textual properties to 5000 characters or less. Google Dataset Search only uses the first 5000 characters of any textual property. Names and titles are typically a few words or a short sentence.
Known Errors and Warnings
You may experience errors or warnings in Google's Structured
Data Testing Tool and other validation systems. Specifically, validation systems may
suggest that organizations should have contact information including a contactType; useful values include
customer service, emergency, journalist, newsroom, and public engagement.
You can also ignore errors for
csvw:Table being an unexpected value for the mainEntity property.
Structured data type definitions
You must include the required properties for your content to be eligible for display as a rich result.
You can also include the recommended properties to add more information about your content,
which could provide a better user experience.
You can use the Structured
Data Testing Tool to validate your markup.
The focus is on describing information about a dataset (its metadata) and representing its
contents. For example, dataset metadata states what the dataset is about, which variables it
measures, who created it, and so on. It does not, for example, contain specific values for the
variables.
Dataset
The full definition of Dataset is available at
schema.org/Dataset.
You can describe additional information about the publication of the dataset, such as the
license, when it was published, its
DOI,
or a sameAs pointing to a canonical version of the dataset in a different
repository. Add identifier, license, and sameAs for
datasets that provide provenance and license information.
Required properties
description
Text
A short summary describing a dataset.
Guidelines
The summary must be between 50 and 5000 characters long.
The summary may include Markdown syntax. Embedded images need to use absolute path URLs
(instead of relative paths).
When using the JSON-LD format, denote new lines with \n (two characters: backslash and lower case
letter "n").
name
Text
A descriptive name of a dataset. For example, "Snow depth in the Northern Hemisphere".
Guidelines
Use unique names for distinct datasets whenever possible.
Recommended:
"Snow depth in the Northern Hemisphere" and "Snow depth in the Southern Hemisphere" for two different datasets.
Not recommended: "Snow depth" and "Snow depth" for two different datasets.
Recommended properties
alternateName
Text
Alternative names that have been used to refer to this dataset, such as aliases or
abbreviations. Example (in JSON-LD format):
"name": "The Quick, Draw! Dataset"
"alternateName": ["Quick Draw Dataset", "quickdraw-dataset"]
creator
Person or
Organization
The creator or author of this dataset. To uniquely identify individuals, use
ORCID ID as the value of the sameAs property
of the Person type. To uniquely identify institutions and organizations, use
ROR ID.
Example (in JSON-LD format):
"creator": [
{
"@type": "Person",
"sameAs": "http://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0000",
"givenName": "Jane",
"familyName": "Foo",
"name": "Jane Foo"
},
{
"@type": "Person",
"sameAs": "http://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0001",
"givenName": "Jo",
"familyName": "Bar",
"name": "Jo Bar"
},
{
"@type": "Organization",
"sameAs": "http://ror.org/xxxxxxxxx",
"name": "Fictitious Research Consortium"
}
]
citation
Text or CreativeWork
Identifies academic articles that are recommended by the data provider be cited in addition to the
dataset itself. Provide the citation for the dataset itself with other properties, such as name, identifier,
creator, and publisher properties.
For example, this property can uniquely identify a related academic publication such as a
data descriptor, data paper, or an article for which this dataset is supplementary
material for. Examples (in JSON-LD format):
"citation": "https://doi.org/10.1111/111"
"citation": "https://identifiers.org/pubmed:11111111"
"citation": "https://identifiers.org/arxiv:0111.1111v1"
"citation":
"Doe J (2014) Influence of X ... https://doi.org/10.1111/111"
Additional guidelines
Donâ€™t use this property to provide citation information for the dataset itself. It is
intended to identify related academic articles, not the dataset itself. To provide
information necessary to cite the dataset itself use name,
identifier, creator, and publisher properties
instead.
When populating the citation property with a citation snippet, provide the
article identifier (such as a DOI) whenever possible.
Recommended:
"Doe J (2014) Influence of X.
Biomics 1(1). https://doi.org/10.1111/111"
Not recommended: "Doe J (2014) Influence of X.
Biomics 1(1)."
hasPart or isPartOf
URL or
Dataset
If the dataset is a collection of smaller datasets, use the hasPart property
to denote such relationship. Conversly, if the dataset is part of a larger
dataset, use isPartOf. Both properties can take the form of a URL
or a Dataset instance. In case Dataset is used as a value it has
to include all of the properties required for a standalone Dataset.
Examples:
"hasPart" : [
{
"@type": "Dataset",
"name": "Sub dataset 01",
"description": "Informative description of the first subdataset...",
"license" : "https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"
},
{
"@type": "Dataset",
"name": "Sub dataset 02",
"description": "Informative description of the second subdataset...",
"license" : "https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"
}
]
"isPartOf" : "https://example.com/aggregate_dataset"
identifier
URL, Text, or PropertyValue
An identifier, such as a DOI or a Compact Identifier. If the dataset has more than one
identifier, repeat the identifier property. If using JSON-LD, this is represented
using JSON list syntax.
keywords
Text
Keywords summarizing the dataset.
license
URL or CreativeWork
A license under which the dataset is distributed. For example:
"license" : "https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"
"license" : {
"@type": "CreativeWork",
"name": "Custom license",
"url": "https://example.com/custom_license"
}
Additional guidelines
Provide a URL that unambiguously identifies a specific version of the license used.
Recommended
"license" : "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0"
Not recommended
"license" : "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by"
measurementTechnique
Text or URL
The technique, technology, or methodology used in a dataset, which can correspond to the variable(s) described in variableMeasured.
The measurementTechnique
property is proposed and pending standardization at schema.org. We encourage publishers to
share any feedback on this property with the schema.org community.
sameAs
URL
The URL of a reference web page that unambiguously indicates the dataset's identity.
spatialCoverage
Text or Place
You can provide a single point that describes the spatial aspect of the dataset. Only
include this property if the dataset has a spatial dimension. For example,
a single point where all the measurements were collected, or the coordinates of a bounding
box for an area.
Points
"spatialCoverage:" {
"@type": "Place",
"geo": {
"@type": "GeoCoordinates",
"latitude": 39.3280,
"longitude": 120.1633
}
}
Shapes
Use GeoShape to describe areas of different shapes. For example, to specify a bounding box.
"spatialCoverage:" {
"@type": "Place",
"geo": {
"@type": "GeoShape",
"box": "39.3280 120.1633 40.445 123.7878"
}
}
Points inside box, circle, line, or
polygon properties must be expressed as a space separated pair of two
values corresponding to latitude and longitude (in that order).
Named locations
"spatialCoverage:" "Tahoe City, CA"
temporalCoverage
Text
The data in the dataset covers a specific time interval. Only include this property if the
dataset has a temporal dimension. Schema.org uses the ISO 8601 standard
to describe time intervals and time points. You can describe dates differently depending
upon the dataset interval. Indicate open-ended intervals with two decimal points (..).
Single date
"temporalCoverage" : "2008"
Time period
"temporalCoverage" : "1950-01-01/2013-12-18"
Open-ended time period
"temporalCoverage" : "2013-12-19/.."
variableMeasured
Text or PropertyValue
The variable that this dataset measures. For example, temperature or pressure.
The variableMeasured
property is proposed and pending standardization at schema.org. We encourage publishers to
share any feedback on this property with the schema.org community.
version
Text or Number
The version number for the dataset.
url
URL
Location of a page describing the dataset.
DataCatalog
The full definition of DataCatalog is available at
schema.org/DataCatalog.
Datasets are often published in repositories that contain many other
datasets. The same dataset can be included in more than one such repository. You
can refer to a data catalog that this dataset belongs to by referencing it
directly.
Recommended properties
includedInDataCatalog
DataCatalog
The catalog to which the dataset belongs.
DataDownload
The full definition of DataDownload is available at
schema.org/DataDownload. In addition to Dataset properties,
add the following properties for datasets that provide download options.
The distribution property describes how to get the dataset itself because the URL
often points to the landing page describing the dataset. The distribution
property describes where to get the data and in what format. This property can
have several values: for instance, a CSV version has one URL and an Excel
version is available at another.
Required properties
distribution.contentUrl
URL
The link for the download.
Recommended properties
distribution
DataDownload
The description of the location for download of the dataset and the file format for
download.
distribution.encodingFormat
Text or URL
The file format of the distribution.
Tabular datasets
Beta: This approach is currently in beta and therefore subject to change.
A tabular dataset is one organized primarily in terms of a grid of rows and columns.
For pages that embed tabular datasets, you can also create more explicit markup, building on the basic approach described above. At this time we understand a variation of
CSVW ("CSV on the Web", see W3C), provided in parallel to user-oriented tabular content on the HTML page.
Here is an example showing a small table encoded in CSVW JSON-LD format. There are some known errors in the Rich Results Test.

Monitor rich results with Search Console
Search Console is a tool that helps you monitor how your pages perform in Google Search.
You don't have to sign up for Search Console to be included in Google Search results,
but it can help you understand and improve how Google sees your site. We
recommend checking Search Console in the following cases:
After deploying structured data for the first time
After releasing new templates or updating your code
Analyzing traffic periodically
After deploying structured data for the first time
After Google has indexed your pages, look for issues using the relevant
Rich result status report.
Ideally you should see an increase of valid pages, and no increase in errors or warnings. If you find issues
in your structured data:
Fix the errors.
Inspect a live URL to check if the issue persists.
Request validation using the status report.
After releasing new templates or updating your code
When you make significant changes to your website, monitor for increases in structured data errors and warnings.
If you see an increase in errors, perhaps you rolled out a new template that doesn't work, or your site interacts with the existing
template in a new and bad way.
If you see a decrease in valid items (not matched by an increase in errors), perhaps you are
no longer embedding structured data in your pages. Use the
URL Inspection tool to learn what is causing the issue.
Analyzing traffic periodically
Analyze your Google Search traffic using the Performance Report.
The data will show you how often your page appears as a rich result in Search, how often users click on it and what is
the average position you appear on search results. You can also automatically pull these
results with the Search
Console API.
Troubleshooting
Important: Google does not guarantee that features that consume structured data will
show up in search results. For a list of common reasons why Google may not
show your content in a rich result, see the General
Structured Data Guidelines.
If you're having trouble implementing structured data, here are some resources that may help you.
You might have an error in your structured data. Check the
list of structured
data errors.
Troubleshoot
missing rich results / drop in total rich results.
For general questions about crawling and indexing, check the
Webmaster FAQ.
Note: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it
may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.

Office Hours.
