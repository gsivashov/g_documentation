Create custom 404 pages
A 404 page is
what a user sees when they try to reach a non-existent page on your site. This may happen if
they've clicked a broken link, the page has been deleted, or they've mistyped a URL.
You can rely on your server to return a standard 404 page, but it might not be attractive, and
won't be branded with your website. A custom 404 page can be branded with your site and
provide helpful information
If you have access to your server, we recommend that you create a custom 404 page. A good
custom 404 page helps people find the information they're looking for, and also
provides other helpful content that encourages people to explore your site further.
This article covers guidelines for creating the content of your custom 404 page. For
information on configuring your server to display your new 404 page, check your server or web
hoster documentation. You should still make sure that your webserver returns a 404 status code
to users and crawlers, so that search engines don't accidentally index your custom 404 page.
Because a 404 page can also be a standard HTML page, you can customize it any way you want.
Here are some suggestions for creating an effective 404 page that can help keep visitors on
your site and find the information they're looking for:
Tell visitors clearly that the page they're looking for can't be found. Use language that is
friendly and inviting.
Make sure your 404 page uses the same look and feel (including navigation) as the rest of
your site.
Consider adding links to your most popular articles or posts, as well as a link to your
site's home page.
Think about providing a way for users to report a broken link.
No matter how beautiful and useful your custom 404 page is, you probably don't want it to
appear in Google search results. To prevent 404 pages from being indexed by Google
and other search engines, make sure that your web server returns an actual 404 HTTP status
code when a missing page is requested.
Use the Change of Address
tool to tell Google about your site move.
