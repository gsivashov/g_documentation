Bloggers
If you have a website but don't have a blog, consider creating one: A blog is a great way to
connect with people who share your interests, or to publicize your site or product. Blogs are
easy to create and update, and rich, useful, and original blog content will encourage readers
to come back to your site. Here are some tips for making the most of your blog.
Create great content
Write well and often. A frequently updated site encourages people to
return - as long as your content remains relevant and engaging. A useful post once a week
is better than low-quality content published daily. A great idea is to search Google for
subjects of interest in your field. If you can't find a good answer, create a blog post
about the subject - chances are that other people are searching for the same thing.
Follow the Webmaster Guidelines. Just like with any other site, make
sure you follow our Webmaster
Guidelines for creating rich, relevant, and useful content. Similarly, check out our
recommendations for using images
and other rich media in your blog.
Categorize your posts. Labels and tags are a great way to organize your
content, and encourage users to browse your blog.
Make sure users (and crawlers) can easily find your blog. We recommending
prominently linking to your blog from your home page, and from other key pages on your site.
Consider hosting your blog on your regular site (http://blog.example.com or www.example.com/blog).
If necessary, limit comment spam. Enabling comments on your blog can help
create a sense of community and discussion. Unfortunately, some spammers use the comment
functionality to flood sites with spam. If this happens to you, check out our
guidelines for reducing
comment spam.
Check our tips for affiliate sites. Google recommends that all site owners
create websites with original content that adds value for users. This is particularly
important for sites that participate in affiliate programs. If you do participate in an
affiliate program, there are a number of steps you can take to help your site stand out
and differentiate it from the crowd. More
information about affiliate programs.
Make sure readers and crawlers can find your content
Create descriptive titles for each of your posts. This makes for a
better user experience. In addition, the post title is often used to create the unique URL
for each post, and this can give search engines valuable information about the content of
your page.
Connect with your online community. There's almost certainly a rich
network of bloggers already talking about the subject matter of your site. Visit these
blogs, comment on posts, and participate in the discussion. Contribute to web forums devoted
to your subject matter. The key is to bring something to the table: Thoughtful comments
with useful information will make readers more likely to visit your site.
Publish a feed of your content. We strongly recommend publishing feeds of
your content, allowing users to be notified whenever you update your blog. You can generally
do this via a setting in your blogging software. Most services give you the option of
publishing a full feed (users can read the full content of your article in their RSS reader)
or a partial feed (users see a teaser paragraph in their reader but have to go to your site
to read the full article). Rich, full-content feeds make users happy because they can view
your content with minimal effort. They may result in a short-term decline in visits to your
actual blog, but the long-term gains of increased readership and mindshare are typically
worth it. Ultimately, keep in mind that a regular subscriber is more valuable than an
occasional visitor.
Your blog and Search Console
Add your blog to your Search Console account. Adding a blog to your
account is easy: Just follow the instructions
for adding a regular site. If you use Blogger,
you can add your sites to your account by clicking Search Console under
Tools and Resources on the Blogger dashboard.
Verify your blog. To see detailed stats and diagnostics about your site,
verify your
ownership. You can verify your site by uploading an HTML file with the filename we
specify, or by adding a meta tag to your blog's template.
Submit a sitemap. Sitemaps
are a great way to tell Google about content on your site we might not otherwise discover.
Google prefers sitemaps created using the sitemap protocol; however, we'll accept several
different formats. If you publish an RSS or Atom feed of your site, you can submit the feed
URL as a sitemap.
