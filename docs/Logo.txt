Logo
Specify the image Google Search uses for your organization's logo in Search
results and in the Knowledge Graph.
Google Search uses the markup in the use
case example to recognize the image to use as the organization’s logo. This
ensures that, when possible, the image appears in search results about the
company. Markup like this is a strong signal to Google Search algorithms to
show this image in Knowledge Graph displays.
How to add structured data
Structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page
content. If you’re new to structured data, you can learn more about
how structured data works.
Here's an overview of how to build, test, and release structured data. For a step-by-step guide
on how to add structured data to a web page, check out the
structured
data codelab.
Add the required properties. For information about where to put
structured data on the page, watch JSON-LD structured
data: Where to insert on the page.
Follow the guidelines.
Validate your code using the
Rich Results Test.
Deploy a few pages that include your structured data and use the URL Inspection tool to test how Google sees the page. Be sure that your page is
accessible to Google and not blocked by a robots.txt file, the noindex tag, or
login requirements. If the page looks okay, you can
ask Google to
recrawl your URLs.
Note: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it
may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
To keep Google informed of future changes, we recommend that you
submit a
sitemap. You can automate this with the
Search Console Sitemap
API.
Example
Here's an example of a logo in JSON-LD code.

Structured data type definitions
For logo usage, Google Search recognizes the following properties of an
Organization.
You must include the required properties for your content to be eligible
for display as a rich result.
Required properties
logo
URL
URL of a logo that is representative of the organization.
Additional image guidelines:
The image must be 112x112px, at minimum.
The image URL must be crawlable and indexable.
The image file format must be supported by Google Images.
url
URL
The URL of the website associated with the logo.
Troubleshooting
Important: Google does not guarantee that features that consume structured data will
show up in search results. For a list of common reasons why Google may not
show your content in a rich result, see the General
Structured Data Guidelines.
If you're having trouble implementing structured data, here are some resources that may help you.
You might have an error in your structured data. Check the
list of structured
data errors.
Troubleshoot
missing rich results / drop in total rich results.
For general questions about crawling and indexing, check the
Webmaster FAQ.
Note: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it
may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
Ask a question in the Webmaster
Office Hours.
Post a question in the Webmaster
forum.
