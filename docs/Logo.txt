Logo
Specify the image Google Search uses for your organization's logo in Search
results and in the Knowledge Graph.
Google Search uses the markup in the use
case example to recognize the image to use as the organizationâ€™s logo. This
ensures that, when possible, the image appears in search results about the
company. Markup like this is a strong signal to Google Search algorithms to
show this image in Knowledge Graph displays.
Example
Here's an example of a logo in JSON-LD code.
