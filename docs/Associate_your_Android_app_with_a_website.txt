Associate your Android app with a websiteYou can associate your Google Play Store Android app with a website property in Search Console. If an app is associated with a website, Google will automatically try to index and crawl your app by inferring the app structure from the website structure, and the website can get a ranking boost in Google Search results.
Associate your app
More details about association
Association between an app and a website (called affiliation in Google Play) verifies to Google that there is a relationship between an app and a website. Association has several benefits:
Associated apps get some free HTTP URL mapping. If you associate your app with a website, Google will try to index your app automatically, based on the structure of the associated website, if the app supports HTTP intents.
Even if the app has not explicitly mapped app pages to web pages, a mobile search result for a website with an associated app can link to the default view for that app.
Opting out of these benefits
You can opt your app out of these benefits while remaining associated with a website using a noindex.xml file in your app.
