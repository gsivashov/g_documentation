Employer Aggregate Rating
Does your site provide salary estimates? Consider adding Estimated salary structured data.
Does your site provide job postings? Consider adding JobPosting structured data.
If your site publishes user-generated ratings about hiring organizations, you should add EmployerAggregateRating structured data to your site. EmployerAggregateRating is an evaluation of a hiring organization compiled from many users. Adding EmployerAggregateRating can provide job seekers with ratings about a hiring organization to help them choose a job. It also offers prominent brand placement in the enriched job search experience on Google.
During the beta phase, we recommended adding review snippet structured data for your page to be eligible for the jobs enriched search results. If you currently have review snippet structured data on your site, we recommend that you transition from review snippet structured data to Employer Aggregate Rating structured data soon.

Add aggregate ratings
Ensure that Googlebot can crawl your web pages that post employer aggregate ratings (not protected by a robots.txt file or robots meta tag).
Follow our guidelines.
Add EmployerAggregateRating structured data to your web page.
Validate your code using the Structured
Data Testing Tool. Paste your code into the tool and click the validate button.
Deploy a few pages using your structured data and use the
URL Inspection tool to test
how Google sees the page.
Be sure that your page is accessible to Google and not blocked by
robots, noindex, or login requirements. If the page looks okay, use that tool to request an
index of the page. Read here to
find out how to test a page
hosted on a local server or behind a firewall.
To monitor errors, verify your site ownership in Search Console. If Search Console notices

Technical guidelines
Make sure that the ratings are available to users from the page where you add EmployerAggregateRating structured data. It should be immediately obvious to users that the page has rating content.
Provide rating information about a specific hiring organization, not about a category or a list of items. For example, “top 10 best places to work” and “tech companies” aren't specific hiring organizations.
By default, Google assumes that your site uses a 5-point scale, where 5 is the best possible rating and 1 is the worst, but you can use any other scale. If you use a different scale, you can specify the best and worst ratings, and Google scales that to the 5-star system.
Content guidelines
Users must be able to post their own ratings on your site and your site must host those user ratings.
The number of ratings should reflect actual ratings that users provide.
The aggregate score should be accurately derived from the provided ratings.
