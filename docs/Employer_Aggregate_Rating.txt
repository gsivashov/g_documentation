Employer Aggregate Rating
Does your site provide salary estimates? Consider adding Estimated salary structured data.
Does your site provide job postings? Consider adding JobPosting structured data.
If your site publishes user-generated ratings about hiring organizations, you should add EmployerAggregateRating structured data to your site. EmployerAggregateRating is an evaluation of a hiring organization compiled from many users. Adding EmployerAggregateRating can provide job seekers with ratings about a hiring organization to help them choose a job. It also offers prominent brand placement in the enriched job search experience on Google.
During the beta phase, we recommended adding review snippet structured data for your page to be eligible for the jobs enriched search results. If you currently have review snippet structured data on your site, we recommend that you transition from review snippet structured data to EmployerAggregateRating structured data soon.

Here's an example for EmployerAggregateRating using JSON-LD code.

How to add structured data
Structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page
content. If you’re new to structured data, you can learn more about
how structured data works.
Here's an overview of how to build, test, and release structured data. For a step-by-step guide
on how to add structured data to a web page, check out the
structured
data codelab.
Add the required properties. For information about where to put
structured data on the page, watch JSON-LD structured
data: Where to insert on the page.
Follow the guidelines.
Validate your code using the
Rich Results Test.
Deploy a few pages that include your structured data and use the URL Inspection tool to test how Google sees the page. Be sure that your page is
accessible to Google and not blocked by a robots.txt file, the noindex tag, or
login requirements. If the page looks okay, you can
ask Google to
recrawl your URLs.
Note: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it
may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
To keep Google informed of future changes, we recommend that you
submit a
sitemap. You can automate this with the
Search Console Sitemap
API.
Guidelines
You must follow these guidelines to be eligible to appear in the Google job search experience.
Warning: If your site violates one or more of these guidelines, then Google may take manual action against it. Once you have remedied the problem, you can submit your site for reconsideration.

General structured data guidelines
Technical guidelines
Make sure that the ratings are available to users from the page where you add EmployerAggregateRating structured data. It should be immediately obvious to users that the page has rating content.
Provide rating information about a specific hiring organization, not about a category or a list of items. For example, “top 10 best places to work” and “tech companies” aren't specific hiring organizations.
By default, Google assumes that your site uses a 5-point scale, where 5 is the best possible rating and 1 is the worst, but you can use any other scale. If you use a different scale, you can specify the best and worst ratings, and Google scales that to the 5-star system.
Content guidelines
Users must be able to post their own ratings on your site and your site must host those user ratings.
The number of ratings should reflect actual ratings that users provide.
The aggregate score should be accurately derived from the provided ratings.
Structured data type definitions
This section describes the structured data types related to employer aggregate ratings. You must
include the required properties for your content to be eligible for display in enhanced search results.
The full definition of EmployerAggregateRating is avalailable at
schema.org/EmployerAggregateRating.
Required properties
itemReviewed
Organization
The organization that is being rated. The itemReviewed property must point to a schema.org/Organization that represents the company being rated.
For example:
{
"@context" : "https://schema.org/",
"@type": "EmployerAggregateRating",
"itemReviewed": {
"@type": "Organization",
"name" : "World's Best Coffee Shop",
"sameAs" : "http://www.worlds-best-coffee-shop.example.com"
}
}
ratingCount
Number
The total number of ratings of the organization on your site. At least one of ratingCount or reviewCount is required.
ratingValue
Number or
Text
A numerical quality rating for the item, either a number, fraction, or percentage (for example, "4", "60%", or "6 / 10").
Google understands the scale for fractions and percentages, since the scale is
implied in the fraction itself or the percentage. The default scale for numbers is a
5-point scale, where 1 is the lowest value and 5 is the highest value.
If another scale is
intended, use bestRating
and worstRating.
reviewCount
Number
Specifies the number of people who provided a review with or without an accompanying
rating. At least one of ratingCount or reviewCount is required.
Recommended properties
bestRating
Number
The highest value allowed in this rating system. If bestRating
is omitted, 5 is assumed.
worstRating
Number
The lowest value allowed in this rating system. If worstRating
is omitted, 1 is assumed.
