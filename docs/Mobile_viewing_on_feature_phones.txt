Mobile viewing on feature phones
Looking for transcoding on smartphones? Learn
more about Web Light.
When users search on Google with a feature phone, Google shows all of the content in the Google
index that's available to desktop web browsers. Because this content isn't written specifically for
feature phones and devices, this content might not display properly. Web search results are
viewed through our transcoder, which analyzes the original HTML code and converts it to a
mobile-ready format. To ensure that the highest quality and most useable web page is displayed on
a mobile phone or device, Google may resize, adjust, or convert images, text formatting and/or
certain aspects of web page functionality.
If you don't want Google to transcode your web page on feature phones, you may request that
Google redirect the user to an alternate page whenever the user attempts to view the page through
the transcoder. You can do so by including the following line in the <head>
section of the HTML file for your page:
<link rel="alternate" media="handheld" href="alternate_page.htm" />
The alternate page should be a mobile-optimized version of the original page or a message
informing the user that the site is not available on the phone.
