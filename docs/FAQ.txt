Guidelines
For your FAQ page to be eligible for FAQ rich results, you must follow these guidelines:
General structured data guidelines
Webmaster guidelines
Content guidelines
Content guidelines
Only use FAQPage if your page has a list of questions with answers. If your page
has a single question and users can submit alternative answers, use
QAPage instead. Here are some examples:
Valid use cases:
An FAQ page written by the site itself, with no way for users to submit alternative answers
A product support page that lists FAQs, with no way for users to submit alternative answers
Invalid use cases:
A forum page where users can submit answers to a single question
A product support page where users can submit answers to a single question
A product page where users can submit multiple questions and answers on a single page
Don’t use FAQPage for advertising purposes.
Make sure each Question includes the entire text of the question and
make sure each Answer includes the entire text of the answer. The entire
question text and answer text may be displayed.
Question and answer content may not be displayed as a rich result if it contains any of the
following types of content: obscene, profane, sexually explicit, graphically violent,
promotion of dangerous or illegal activities, or hateful or harassing language.
All FAQ content must be visible to the user on the source page.
If you have FAQ content that is repetitive on your site (meaning, the same question and answer appear on multiple pages
on your site), mark up only one instance of that FAQ for your entire site.
Structured data type definitions
You must include the required properties for your content to be eligible for display as a rich
