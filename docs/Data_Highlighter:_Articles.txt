Data Highlighter: ArticlesYou can use Data Highlighter to tag data in a newspaper or magazine article, such as its title, author, and ratings. Then Google can present your data more attractively -- and in new ways -- in search results and in other products. (Each Google product applies its own rules when deciding whether and how to display your data.)
Article tags
You can use Data Highlighter to tag any of the data described in the table below. Each tag corresponds to a property in the schema.org/Article schema. The name of each tag is followed by the name of the schema.org property in parentheses.  Required tags are listed in bold.
Note that the data you can tag with Data Highlighter is a subset of the properties in the schema.org schema.
If your site is missing any of the data described below, you can add missing data from Data Highlighter. If Data Highlighter has a low level of confidence in the tagged data, an alert icon () displays while you are creating a page set. Data Highlighter will still make the low-confidence data available to Google, but other Google products might not use it.
Tag
Description
Title
(name)
The title of the article.
Author
(author)
An author of the article. You can tag more than one author name if the article has multiple authors.
Date Published
(datePublished)
The date the article was published. For details on how to tag dates, see Tagging Dates.
Here are some examples of dates you can tag:
A single date. For example, you can tag any of the following:
June 4, 2012
4 June 2012
6/4/12 - Your tags can include other delimiters and four-digit years as well, such as 6-4-2012. When numerical dates are ambiguous, Google assumes that the first number is the month. For example, 6/4/12 is intrepreted as June 4, 2012, while 13/4/12 would be interpreted as April 13, 2012.
You can tag multiple dates on a page. For example, if you tag June 4, 2012 and June 6, 2012, the event will be intepreted as occuring twice: once on June 4th and once on June 6th.
A range of days. For example, June 4-7 2012
Note that delimiter between the beginning and ending days needs to be a dash (-).
Dates with times. For example, you can tag any of the following:
June 4, 2012 3pm - a time followed by am or pm. Google uses normal business hours to interpet times not followed by am or pm. For example, 11 would be interpreted as 11am and 2 would be interpreted as 2pm.
June 4, 2012 15:00 - military time
June 4, 2012 3pm EST or  June 4, 2012 3pm -5:00 - Times with a time zone or with a UTC/GMT offset.
June 4, 2012 2-3pm or  June 4-5, 2012 2-3pm - Time ranges with or without a date range.
Dates in separate pieces.You can use the advanced tagging option to tag the following separate pieces of text as a single date:
Day: Tuesday, June 4 Year: 2013
June 4 | Time: 7:30pm-9:30pm and 2012
Google does not recognize date ranges that have been split into multiple tags. For example, the following tags are not valid date tags:
June 4-5 and 2012
Image
(image)
An image from the article. For example, you can tag an image that appears in the article. You can tag more than one image.
Category

A section of the newspaper or magazine in which the article is published. For example, Lifestyle or Sports. You can tag more than one category.
Average Rating (aggregateRating)
The overall rating of the article, specified by the following tags (see Tagging ratings for more information):
Tag
Description
Rating
(ratingValue and
bestRating)
Words, numbers, or an image that describes the rating. The rating must specify the best possible rating and the actual rating.
If a single piece of data specifes both the best possible rating and the actual rating, you can use a single Rating tag. For example, tag 65% to indicate a score of 65 out of 100; tag 8 out of 10 to indicate a score of 8 out of 10.
If the data is in different locations on a page, specify the following tags:
Score (ratingValue) - The actual rating.
Best Possible (bestRating) - The highest value in the rating system. For example, if the rating scale is between one and five stars, specify 5 as the best rating.
Votes
(ratingCount)
The total number of ratings.
