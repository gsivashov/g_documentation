Featured snippets and your website
Featured snippets are special boxes where the format of a regular search result is reversed, showing
the descriptive snippet
first. Read more about how Google's Featured Snippets work.
How can I opt out of featured snippets?
There are two ways that you can opt out of featured snippets:
Block both featured and regular search snippets
Block featured snippets only
Block both featured and regular search snippets
The nosnippet tag
blocks all snippets (featured snippets and regular snippets) for the tagged page.
Text marked by the
data-nosnippet tag
won't appear in featured snippets (or regular snippets either).
If both nosnippet and
data-nosnippet appear in a page,
nosnippet takes priority, and snippets won't be shown for the
page.
Block featured snippets only
Those who wish to retain snippets in regularly-formatted search results but not appear in
featured snippets should experiment with setting the
max-snippet tag
to lower lengths. Featured snippets will only appear if enough text can be shown to generate a
useful featured snippet.
Keep lowering the value if pages continue to show for featured snippets. In general, the
shorter your max-snippet tag setting, the less likely the page
will appear as a featured snippet.
Google does not provide an exact minimum length required to appear as a featured snippet.
This is because the minimum length is variable based on a number of factors, including—but not
limited to—the information in the snippet, the language, and the platform (mobile device, app,
or desktop).
Using a low max-snippet setting doesn't guarantee that Google will
stop showing featured snippets for your page. If you need a guaranteed solution, use the
nosnippet tag.
How can I mark my page as a featured snippet?
You can't. Google systems determine whether a page would make a good featured snippet for a
user's search request, and if so, elevates it.
What happens when a user clicks a featured snippet?
Clicking a featured snippet takes the user directly to the section of the page that appeared
in the featured snippet. Scrolling to the position that appeared in the snippet happens
automatically, without any additional annotation by the site. If a browser doesn't support the
underlying technology needed, or if our systems can't confidently determine exactly where
within a page to direct a click, clicking a featured snippet will take a user to the top of
the source web page.
