Submit URLs to Google
The simplest way to submit your new and updated URLs is to
verify your site ownership
on Search Console. After you verify, use the
Sitemaps report to see
which sitemaps were processed for your site, any processing errors, or to submit a new sitemap
for your site.
Are you using a hosted content management platform (for example, Blogger or
Wordpress)? In most cases, the platform submits your new content to search engines automatically.
Check your platform's support articles.
The video below explains what a sitemap is, whether you need one or not, and how to submit
a sitemap and track its status using Search Console.
Notify us of changes
When you make changes to your structured data and you want to notify our
systems ahead of our regular schedule, you can resubmit your sitemap to Search
Console following the same process you used to submit your first sitemap.
If you use XML format, change the <lastmod> field to the date of the change.
Read more
about this field in the Sitemap.org tag definitions.
Other XML files have a similar field, such as <updated> for Atom XML.
You can also learn how to compute this date.
If you prefer, we also support the following programmatic methods to notify us
of your content updates:
Ping Google specifically with the location of the sitemap:
http://www.google.com/ping?sitemap=URL/of/file
Use Pubsubhubbub
if you use Atom/RSS for your sitemap and want to broadcast your changes to other search
engines in addition to Google.

a sitemap and make it available to Google.
