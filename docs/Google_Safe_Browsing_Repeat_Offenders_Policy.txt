Google Safe Browsing Repeat Offenders Policy
Google Safe Browsing helps protect users by showing warnings on dangerous sites or dangerous download files. Safe Browsing also notifies website owners when their websites are compromised by malicious actors and helps them diagnose and resolve the problem so that their visitors stay safer.
Sites that repeatedly switch between compliant and noncompliant behavior within a short window of time will be classified as Repeat Offenders.
When a site is established as a Repeat Offender, the website owner will be notified via email to their registered Search Console email address. Once Safe Browsing has designated a site as a Repeat Offender, the website owner will be unable to request additional reviews via the Search Console. Repeat Offender status persists for 30 days, after which the website owner will be able to request a review.
