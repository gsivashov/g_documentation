Cloaking
Cloaking refers to the practice of presenting different content or URLs to human users and
search engines. Cloaking is considered a violation of Google's
Webmaster Guidelines
because it provides our users with different results than they expected.
Some examples of cloaking include:
Serving a page of HTML text to search engines, while showing a page of images to users
Inserting text or keywords into a page only when the user agent that's requesting the page
is a search engine, not a human visitor
If your site uses technologies that search engines have difficulty accessing, like JavaScript
or images, see our
recommendations for making that content accessible to search engines and users without
cloaking.
If a site gets hacked, it's not uncommon for the hacker to use cloaking to make the hack
harder for the site owner to detect. Read
more about hacked sites.
