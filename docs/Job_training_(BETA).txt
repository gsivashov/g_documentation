Looking for other job-related features?
Does your site provide job postings? Consider adding JobPosting structured data in addition to job training structured data.
Does your site provide reviews about other employers? Add Employer Aggregate Rating structured data.
Does your site provide salary estimates? Add Estimated salary structured data.
For job seekers and prospective students looking to acquire marketable skills for their next
role, itâ€™s often difficult to find programs, compare cost, and know which jobs are in demand. The
job training experience on Google Search helps people discover a new career path and acquire skills for
their next job. Learn more about the job
training experience on Google.
You can integrate with the job training experience by adding structured data to your program
web pages. Structured data helps Google better understand the content of your page, and
therefore enables Google to better surface job training programs to users. If you're getting
started with structured data, read our guide to
Understand how structured data works.
Note: The actual appearance in search results might be different.
Feature availability
To ensure a good user experience, we're slowly rolling out coverage throughout the US. We are
currently developing this feature and you may see changes in requirements or guidelines. You
may not see results in Google Search right away. To ensure robust coverage and better serve our
users, this feature is currently limited to
job training providers in the
US.

Guidelines
You must follow these guidelines to be eligible to appear in the job training experience on Google.
Warning: If Google detects that some of the markup on your pages
may be using techniques that are outside our structured data guidelines, your site may receive
a manual action.
Program eligibility guidelines
Enriched Search quality guidelines
Webmaster guidelines
General structured data guidelines
Program eligibility
To be eligible for the program, you must meet the following criteria:
Your web page includes all required structured data properties.
Eligible programs must lead to occupations that require less than a bachelor's degree.
This includes certificate programs, associate degrees, and other programs that require
full-time enrollment of up to around two years, where students pay to attend. For example,
community college programs, private college programs, employer-run education, NGO-led
education, and occupation-specific education.
For programs that pay a wage, there is no limit
to the length of the program. For example, employer-run apprenticeships, on-the-job trainings,
and union and NGO apprenticeships.
The program must match occupations that are in-demand in your area.
The program accepts applicants with no degree beyond a high school diploma.
The completion of the program prepares students for an occupation. Preparatory courses
aren't accepted.
The program must have a local presence. Online-only programs are not accepted.
Programs that require students to pay to attend are eligible, as long as the programs are intended to be
around two years or less for full-time enrolled students.
Programs that train for a job but donâ€™t have credits or donâ€™t lead to a degree are
allowed.
For the small subset of occupations that have programmatic accreditation according to the US DoE, programs must have
programmatic accreditation (for example, physical therapy assistant).
Even though the feature is focused on a subset of positions, you can implement markup on all of
your programs should this feature or other features use this information in the future.
Structured data type definitions
This section describes the structured data types related to the job training experience on Google.
Programs must add one of the following types based on the type of program:
Does the program cost money or is it free to attend? Add the EducationalOccupationalProgram properties.
Does the program provide a wage while the sudent attends the program? Add WorkBasedProgram properties.
Work-based programs can also use Job Posting
structured data in addition to or in place of
Work-based structured data.
If your institution has an accreditation from a certification board, use the
EducationalOrganization
properties. You can add EducationalOrganization to a top-level page on your site,
or as a provider field for a specific
program.
You must include the required properties for your content to be eligible for display in enhanced Search results.
You can also include the recommended properties to add more information about your content,
which could provide a better user experience.
EducationalOccupationalProgram
The full definition of EducationalOccupationalProgram is available at
schema.org/EducationalOccupationalProgram.
The following properties are required for programs with a cost or are free. If the program is
work-based, add the WorkBasedProgram properties instead.
Required properties
applicationDeadline
DateTime
The date at which the program will stop accepting applications in
ISO-8601 format.
If the program is offered more than once per calendar year, specify the deadline for each
date that term applications end. If applications are rolling,
specify the latest possible date.
Starting Jan 2020, we changed our documentation to require
applicationDeadline instead of offers.availabilityEnds.
While we continue to support offers.availabilityEnds, we require
applicationDeadline moving forward.
"applicationDeadline": "2020-04-01T19:30"
identifier
PropertyValue
A property value containing two entries:
CIP2010
The 6 digit CIP code, as published in the 2010 specification from the US Department of Education.
ProgramID
The program identifier, as used by the institution (if applicable).
For example:
"identifier": [
{
"@type": "PropertyValue",
"propertyID": "CIP2010",
"value": "12.3456"
},
{
"@type": "PropertyValue",
"propertyID": "ProgramID",
"value": "CS-101"
}
]
name
Text
The name of the program.
offers
Offer
The estimated cost for the program, if applicable. The estimated cost can be the total
cost of the program or broken down by tuition, fees, and other costs. The cost must be the
cost for in-state residents without aid.
Additional guidelines:
offers.priceSpecification.price must be a number (no other text is accepted).
Only include fees that are related to the program. For example: scrubs, estimated cost
of required textbooks, shopping cart fees.
Don't include fees that aren't required to complete the program. For example,
post-graduation tests, pre-admission tests, room and board, health care, child care.
Example of total cost
If you know the total cost, provide one Offer with that total cost program,
including tuition, fees, books, materials, and supplies of any educational component.
For example:
{
"@type": "Offer",
"category": "Total Cost",
"priceSpecification": {
"@type": "PriceSpecification",
"price": 16200,
"priceCurrency": "USD"
}
Example of a cost breakdown
If you know tuition and fees separately, you can submit them to us separately, and we
will add them together for a total cost. For example:
[
{
"@type": "Offer",
"category": "Tuition",
"priceSpecification": {
"@type": "PriceSpecification",
"price": 16000,
"priceCurrency": "USD"
},{
"@type": "Offer",
"category": "Program Fees",
"priceSpecification": {
"@type": "PriceSpecification",
"price": 200,
"priceCurrency": "USD"
}
]
Example of a tuition calculation breakdown
If you need to calculate tuition based on per credit cost and number of credits, with
fees separately, you can submit them to us separately, and we will add them together for
a total cost. For example, $400/credit X 40 credits = $16000 cost, plus $200 in fees for
a total cost of $16,200:
[
{
"@type": "Offer",
"category": "CostPerCredit",
"priceSpecification": {
"@type": "PriceSpecification",
"price": 400,
"priceCurrency": "USD"
}, {
"@type": "Offer",
"category": "Program Fees",
"priceSpecification": {
"@type": "PriceSpecification",
"price": 200,
"priceCurrency": "USD"
}
]

offers
Offer
The estimated cost for the program, if applicable. The estimated cost can be the total
cost of the program or broken down by tuition, fees, and other costs. The cost must be the
cost for in-state residents without aid.
Additional guidelines:
Offer.price_specification.price must be a number (no other text is accepted).
Only include fees that are related to the program. For example: scrubs, estimated cost
of required textbooks, shopping cart fees.
Don't include fees that aren't required to complete the program. For example,
post-graduation tests, pre-admission tests, room and board, health care, child care.
Example of total cost
If you know the total cost, provide one Offer with that total cost program,
including tuition, fees, books, materials, and supplies of any educational component.
For example:
{
"@type": "Offer",
"category": "Total Cost",
"priceSpecification": {
"@type": "PriceSpecification",
"price": 16200,
"priceCurrency": "USD"
}
Example of a cost breakdown
If you know tuition and fees separately, you can submit them to us separately, and we
will add them together for a total cost. For example:
[
{
"@type": "Offer",
"category": "Tuition",
"priceSpecification": {
"@type": "PriceSpecification",
"price": 16000,
"priceCurrency": "USD"
},{
"@type": "Offer",
"category": "Program Fees",
"priceSpecification": {
"@type": "PriceSpecification",
"price": 200,
"priceCurrency": "USD"
}
]
Example of a tuition calculation breakdown
If you need to calculate tuition based on per credit cost and number of credits, with
fees separately, you can submit them to us separately, and we will add them together for
a total cost. For example, $400/credit X 40 credits = $16000 cost, plus $200 in fees for
a total cost of $16,200:
[
{
"@type": "Offer",
"category": "CostPerCredit",
"priceSpecification": {
"@type": "PriceSpecification",
"price": 400,
"priceCurrency": "USD"
}, {
"@type": "Offer",
"category": "Program Fees",
"priceSpecification": {
"@type": "PriceSpecification",
"price": 200,
"priceCurrency": "USD"
}
]
offers.category
Text
The category of the costs that are related to the program.
If the tuition is different for in-state and out-of-state students, you can use
additional category fields to specify that. You can add similar categories for
"In-district", "Out-of-district" and so on. Here are some example values for
offers.category:
Total Cost
