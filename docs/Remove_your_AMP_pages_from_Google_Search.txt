Remove your AMP pages from Google Search
This page describes how web developers can remove their AMP pages from Google Search.
Key Point: Throughout this page, we
refer to canonical pages, AMP pages, and non-AMP pages. The canonical page can be either a
non-AMP version of the page or it can be the AMP page itself. You may have one of two
possible page setups:
Canonical AMP: One version of a page, where the AMP page is the canonical page.
Canonical non-AMP: Two versions of a page that includes an AMP page and a canonical non-AMP page.
There are three options for removing AMP content:
Quickly remove all versions of a page, including the AMP and canonical non-AMP pages
Remove only the AMP page that is paired with a canonical non-AMP page, while keeping the canonical non-AMP page live
Remove AMP content with a CMS (with options to remove all versions of a page, or only the AMP version)
Remove all versions of AMP content, including AMP and non-AMP
This section describes how to remove all versions of AMP content from Google Search, which includes AMP and non-AMP pages.
Caution: This method might display an error message to the user.
Only use this method to remove your AMP page as quickly as possible from Google Search.
To remove AMP and non-AMP pages from Google Search, follow the steps below:
Delete the AMP and non-AMP versions of the page from your server or CMS.
Use the Remove
outdated content tool to request the removal of your page. Enter the URLs
(web addresses) to your AMP and non-AMP versions of the page that you want to
remove.
Update the
Google AMP Cache to ensure that your AMP content is removed from the cache.
Verify the removal of your AMP page by searching for your content using
Google Search. To verify the removal of a large number of AMP pages, use the AMP status report in Search Console.
Watch for a
decreasing trendline on the "indexed AMP pages" graph.
You can check the status of your request on the Remove outdated
content page.
Note: When you delete your AMP page, there's a delay before the
Googlebot discovers it has been removed. Google Search displays an error to the
user during this time.
Remove only AMP pages, while preserving the canonical non-AMP pages
This section describes how to remove only AMP pages from Google Search, while still
preserving your canonical non-AMP pages.
Caution: Don't remove AMP content by simply deleting content in
the file. Documents that are empty and missing all markup are considered
invalid. When Google Search recognizes that a document is invalid, Google Search
continues to serve the oldest valid version that's available.
To remove the AMP version of your page from Google Search (while preserving
the canonical non-AMP page), follow the steps below:
Remove the rel="amphtml" link from the canonical non-AMP page in the
source code.
Configure your server to return either an HTTP 301 Moved
Permanently or 302 Found response for the removed AMP page.
Configure a redirect from the removed AMP page to the canonical non-AMP page.
If you want to remove an AMP page from non-Google platforms in addition to
removing from Google Search, complete the steps below:
Remove your AMP page so that it is no longer accessible by configuring your server to send an
HTTP 404 Not Found for your removed AMP page. This ensures that the Google AMP Cache
doesn't serve stale content to other platforms.
Update the
Google AMP Cache to ensure that your AMP content is removed from the cache.
Verify the removal of your AMP page by searching for your content in Google Search. To verify
removal of a large number of AMP pages, use the
AMP status report in Search Console.
Watch for a decreasing trendline on
the "indexed AMP pages" graph.
If you want to keep permalinks active, configure your server to send
an HTTP 301 Redirect for your removed AMP page to your canonical non-AMP
page.
Remove AMP and non-AMP pages with a CMS
Generally, CMS providers publish AMP and non-AMP pages at the same time. To
remove a single page, unpublish or delete the page, which removes both the AMP
and non-AMP versions of that page.
Delete a single page
To delete a page and stop publishing it in both its AMP and non-AMP forms, use
the CMS interface. Check your CMS provider's help page for details on how to
stop serving AMP:
WordPress.com
help
Drupal
help
SquareSpace
help
Remove all AMP pages
Another option is to disable AMP from your CMS.
Warning: This option removes all AMP pages from your site.
To disable AMP, check your CMS provider's help page or contact your CMS provider. If your site is
hosted on a CMS domain, the CMS can redirect users to the canonical non-AMP page after AMP
is disabled. If the redirect doesn't occur, contact your CMS provider for assistance.
