Rich media file best practices
Google can index most
types of pages and files. Here are a few details about some specific rich media types:
General best practices
If you do plan to use rich media on your site, here are some recommendations that can help
prevent problems.
Try to use rich media only where it is needed. We recommend that you use
HTML for content and navigation.
Provide text versions of pages. If you use a non-HTML splash screen on
the home page, make sure to include a regular HTML link on that front page to a text-based
page where a user (or Googlebot) can navigate throughout your site without the need for
rich media.
In general, search engines are text based. This means that in order to be crawled and
indexed, your content needs to be in text format.
This doesn't mean that you can't include rich media content such as Silverlight or videos on
your site; it just means that any content you embed in these files should also be available in
text format or it might not be accessible to all search engines. The examples below focus on
the most common types of non-text content, but the guidelines are similar for any other types:
provide text equivalents for all non-text files. (Also note that Flash is no longer supported.)
This will not only increase Googlebot's ability to successfully crawl and index your content;
it will also make your content more accessible. Many people, for example users with visual
impairments, who use screen readers, or have low bandwidth connections, cannot see images on
web pages, and providing text equivalents widens your audience.
Video

IFrames
IFrames are sometimes used to display content on web pages. Content displayed via iFrames
may not be indexed and available to appear in Google's search results. We recommend that you
avoid the use of iFrames to display content. If you do include iFrames, make sure to provide
additional text-based links to the content they display, so that Googlebot can crawl and index
this content.
Flash
Flash is no longer supported. We recommend using a different format, such as HTML5.
