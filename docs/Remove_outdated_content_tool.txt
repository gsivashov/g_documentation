Remove outdated content toolRemove snippets and cached content for pages that you don't ownWhat is this tool used for?
If you see a search result that you do not own, and either
the result snippet or the cached (stored) result in Search results is different from the current page, OR
the page no longer exists, then
You can request that Google drop the outdated cache and snippet from search results, as described in "How do I use the tool".
What is this tool not used for?
Do not use this tool if you think the information on the page is wrong, bad, illegal, etc. If you think the current information is bad, wrong, dangerous, personal, or harmful, see here.
If you are a verified owner of the page in Search Console, use this tool instead.
If you want to permanently remove a search result for a URL that is publicly accessible. See here for more about removing information from Google and the web.
How do I use the tool?
Read "What is this tool used for" and "What is this tool not used for" above.
Open the Remove Outdated Content tool
Enter the URL of the search result to clear. Learn how to get this URL.
Click Request Removal. You will see a list of your requested removals at the bottom of the page.
Periodically check back to see if your removal was granted. If granted, see the next section. If denied, there will be an explanation why.
What will a successful request do?
If your request is successful:
Google will remove the snippet and cached copy from search results.
If the page is no longer available, it will remove the search result entirely.
If the page is still available, it will remove the currently cached version and snippet from search results. The page can still appear in search results, but without a snippet or cached version. The cached version and snippet will be refreshed in search results the next time Google's crawler visits the page.
Why was my request denied?
Please see this help topic for explanations why a snippet or cache removal request might be denied.
What is a snippet and a cached copy?
A snippet is a computer-generated summary of the page. Learn more.
When Googlebot (Google's crawler) crawls a page, it makes a copy of the page that can be viewed in search result. This stored copy of the page is called a cached copy, cached version, or sometimes simply "cache".
