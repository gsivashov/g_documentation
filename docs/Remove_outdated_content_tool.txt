Remove outdated content toolRemove snippets and cached content for pages that you don't ownUse this tool to have Google update search results for pages that no longer exist, or have significant changes on them (removal of specific content).
If your request is approved:
Google will remove the snippet and cached copy from Search results.
If the page is no longer available, it will no longer appear in Search results.
If the page is still available but changed, it will remove the snippet and cached copy from Search results, but both will be refreshed the next time Google's crawler visits the page. Until that time, the page can still appear in Search results.
What this tool is used for
Use this tool only if:
You see a search result that you do not own, and
The page no longer exists OR the result snippet or the cached (stored) result in Search results is significantly different from the current page.
What this tool is not used for
Do not use this tool if:
... you think the information on the page is wrong, bad, illegal, etc. If you think the current information is bad, wrong, dangerous, personal, or harmful, see here.
... you are a verified owner of the page in Search Console. If you are a verified owner, use this tool instead.
... you want to permanently remove a search result for a URL that is publicly accessible. See here for more about removing information from Google and the web.
... you just want Google to recrawl a page. If a page has not been removed or had significant changes (removal of important images or critical information), then this request will fail. Here's how to ask Google for a simple recrawl.
Request update in Search
Understand what the tool is used for and what the tool is not used for above. (Hint: it will not remove a page or image that still exists and has not changed.)
Open the Remove Outdated Content tool
Enter the URL of the search result to verify.
If you are reporting an image that has changed or been removed, you will need both the image URL and the URL of the containing page.
If you are reporting a page that has been changed or removed, simply use the page URL. Learn how to get this URL.
Click Submit. If the page or image are no longer at the specified URL, you will see a list of your requested removals at the bottom of the page. If the page or image still exist at the URL, you will be asked for additional information.
Periodically check back to see if your removal was granted. If denied, there will be an explanation why.
Why was my request denied?
Please see this help topic for explanations why a snippet or cache removal request might be denied.
What is a snippet and a cached copy?
Snippet: A computer-generated summary of the page. Learn more.
Cached copy: When Googlebot (Google's crawler) crawls a page, it makes a copy of the page that can be viewed in Search results. This stored copy of the page is called a cached copy or cached version.
