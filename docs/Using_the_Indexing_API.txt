Using the Indexing API
Overview
You can use the Indexing API to tell Google to update or remove pages from the Google index.
The requests must specify the location of a web page. You can also get the status of notifications
that you have sent to Google. Currently, the Indexing API can only be used to crawl pages with
either JobPosting or
BroadcastEvent embedded in a
VideoObject.
When you send a request to the Indexing API, define location of a standalone web page to
notify Google that it can crawl or remove this page from its index.
The following examples show the actions that you can perform with the Indexing
API:
Update a URL
Send the following HTTP POST request to https://indexing.googleapis.com/v3/urlNotifications:publish endpoint
{
"url": "https://careers.google.com/jobs/google/technical-writer",
"type": "URL_UPDATED"
}
Remove a URL
Send the following HTTP POST request to https://indexing.googleapis.com/v3/urlNotifications:publish endpoint
{
"url": "https://careers.google.com/jobs/google/technical-writer",
"type": "URL_DELETED"
}
Get notification status
Send a HTTP GET request to https://indexing.googleapis.com/v3/urlNotifications/metadata endpoint
Parameters
The following table describes the fields needed for all methods (update and remove a URL):
Fields
url
Required
The fully-qualified location of the item that you want to update or remove.
type
Required
The type of the notification that you submitted.
Guidelines
The following guidelines apply to update and remove a URL requests.
All calls to https://indexing.googleapis.com/v3/UrlNotifications:publish MUST use "application/json" as the Content-Type header.
You can submit one URL only in the body of an update request, or combine up to 100 requests
in a batch, as described in Send batch indexing requests.
The request body in these examples is the value of the content variable that is used
in the access token examples.
Update a URL
To notify Google of a new URL to crawl or that content at a previously-submitted URL has been
updated, follow the steps below:
Submit a POST request to the following endpoint:
Send a HTTP POST request to https://indexing.googleapis.com/v3/urlNotifications:publish
In the body of the request, specify the location of the page using the following syntax:
{
"url": "content_location",
"type": "URL_UPDATED"
}
Google responds to successful Indexing API calls with the an HTTP 200. An HTTP 200 response means that Google may try to recrawl this URL soon. The body of
the response contains a UrlNotificationMetadata object, whose fields correspond to those returned by a notification status request.
If you don't receive an HTTP 200 response, see the Indexing API specific errors.
If the page's contents change, submit another update notification, which should trigger Google to
recrawl the page.
You may need more quota than the default. To view your current quota and request more quota, see Quota.
Remove a URL
After you delete a page from your servers or add <meta name="robots" content="noindex" /> tag in the
<head> section of a given page, notify Google so that we can remove the page from
our index and so that we don't attempt to crawl and index the page again. Before you request removal,
URL must return a 404 or 410 status code or the page contains <meta name="robots" content="noindex" /> meta tag.
To request removal from our index, follow the steps below:
Submit a POST request to the
following endpoint:
Send a HTTP POST request to https://indexing.googleapis.com/v3/urlNotifications:publish
Specify the URL that you want to remove in the body of the request using the following syntax:
{
"url": "content_location",
"type": "URL_DELETED"
}
For example:
{
"url": "https://careers.google.com/jobs/google/technical-writer",
"type": "URL_DELETED"
}
Google responds to successful Indexing API calls with the an HTTP 200. An HTTP 200 response means that Google may remove this URL from the index. The body of
the response contains a UrlNotificationMetadata object, whose fields correspond to those returned by a notification status request.
If you don't receive an HTTP 200 response, see the Indexing API specific errors.
You may need more quota than the default. To view your current quota and request more quota, see Quota.
Get notification status
You can use the Indexing API to check the last time Google received each kind of notification for a given URL. The GET request doesn't tell you when Google indexes or removes a URL; it only returns whether you successfully submitted a request.
To get the status of a notification, follow the steps below:
Submit a GET request to
the following endpoint. The URLs you specify must be URL-encoded. For example, replace : (colons) with %3A
and / (forward slashes) with %2F.
Send a HTTP GET request to https://indexing.googleapis.com/v3/urlNotifications/metadata?url=url-encoded_url
For example:
GET https://indexing.googleapis.com/v3/urlNotifications/metadata?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcareers.google.com%2Fjobs%2Fgoogle%2Ftechnical-writer
The Indexing API responds with an
HTTP 200 message, with a payload that contains details about the notification. The following example shows the body of a response that contains information about an update and delete notification:
{
url: “http://foo.com“
latest_update {
type: “URL_UPDATED”
notify_time: “2017-07-31T19:30:54.524457662Z”
}
latest_remove {
type: “URL_DELETED”
notify_time: “2017-08-31T19:30:54.524457662Z”
}
}
If you don't receive an HTTP 200 response, see the Indexing API specific errors.
You may need more quota than the default. To view your current quota and request more quota, see Quota.
Send batch indexing requests
To reduce the number of HTTP connections your client has to make, you can combine up to 100 calls
to the Indexing API into a single HTTP request. You do this in a multi-part request called a
batch.
Quota is counted at the URL level. For example, if you combine 10 requests into a
single HTTP request, it still counts as 10 requests for your quota. Learn more about how to Request more quota.
When sending a batch request to the Indexing API, use the following endpoint:
https://indexing.googleapis.com/batch
The body of a batch request contains multiple parts. Each part is itself a complete HTTP request,
with its own verb, URL, headers, and body. Each part within a batch request cannot exceed 1MB in
size.
To make it easier for you to send batch requests, Google's API Client Libraries support batching
functionality. For more information about batching with the client libraries, see the following
language-specific pages:
Java
Python
JavaScript
PHP
.NET
If you use the batching examples on these pages, you may need to update your
code to reflect the implementation requirements described in
Get an access token.
The following example batch request message body includes an update notification and a removal notification:
