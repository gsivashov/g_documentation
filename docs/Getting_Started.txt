Getting Started
What are the top three things I should know when building a site for mobile devices?
1. Make it easy for customers.
Help your site's visitors to complete their objectives. They may want to be
entertained by your blog posts, get your restaurant's address, or check reviews
on your products. Design your site to help make it easier for your customer to
visit your site and complete a task.
Outline the potential steps in your customers' journey to make sure
that the steps are easy to complete on a mobile device. Try to streamline the
experience and reduce the number of user interactions. In this example: (1) the
customer clicks on a site after searching for lamps to buy; (2) browses through
a selection of lamps; and (3) purchases the desired lamp.
2. Measure the effectiveness of your website by how easily mobile customers can complete common tasks.
Making a mobile site requires prioritization. Start by working out what the
most important and common tasks are for your customers on mobile. Being able
to support these tasks is critical and this is why the measure of your
mobile site is how well customers can complete their objectives. There are ways
to make the design of your site support ease of use too. Focus on consistency in
your interface and providing an unified experience across platforms.
"Mobile shoppers put ease of use foremost when it comes to mobile shopping
sites, with 48% of respondents citing it as the most important quality of a
mobile site they visit," says
MediaPost.
3. Select a mobile template, theme, or design that's consistent for all devices (for example, use responsive web design).
Responsive web design means that the page uses the same URL and
the same code whether the user is on a desktop computer, tablet, or mobile
phone – only the display adjusts or responds according to the screen size.
Google recommends using responsive web design over other design patterns. One of the
benefits of responsive web design is that you only need to maintain one version of your site
instead of two. You don't have to maintain the desktop site at
www.example.com and the mobile version at m.example.com – you'll maintain only
one site, such as www.example.com, for desktop and mobile visitors.
A responsive site adjusts the display to various screen sizes while
using the same URL and code. All three devices above use www.example.com
(rather than the mobile page at m.example.com and the tablet page at
t.example.com).
"Using responsive web design enabled Baines & Ernst to optimise its site experience across
different screen sizes without creating multiple websites. They noticed that
visitors visited 11% more pages on their site per visit and mobile conversions
grew by 51%."
Conversions happen when a customer performs a desired action, such as buying
products, calling the business, or signing-up for a newsletter.
For details on how to implement responsive web design, refer to Web Fundamentals. If you'd like to weigh the pros and cons of different
implementations for mobile, tablet, and desktop websites, read Building
Websites for the Multi-Screen Consumer.
What are the top three mistakes beginners want to avoid?
Mistake 1 - Forgetting their mobile customer.
Remember that good mobile sites are useful – they help visitors complete
their tasks, whether that's reading an interesting article or checking your
store's location. Don't get caught in the trap of only creating a
mobile-formatted site that doesn't provide the full functionality. Instead, remember to build a
mobile-friendly site (one that's truly useful for mobile customers and
optimized for customers most common tasks).
Mistake 2 - Implementing the mobile site on a different domain, subdomain, or subdirectory from the desktop site.
While Google supports multiple mobile site configurations, creating
separate mobile URLs greatly increases the amount of work required to maintain
and update your site, and introduces possible sources of technical problems.
You can often simplify things significantly by using responsive web design and serving desktop and mobile on the same URL. Responsive web design is
Google's recommended configuration.
Mistake 3 - Working in isolation rather than looking around for inspiration.
Check out other sites in your space or your competitors for inspiration and
best practices. While you may not be the first in your industry with a mobile
site, you have the benefit of being able to learn from those before you.
