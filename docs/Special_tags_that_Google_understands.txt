Special tags that Google understands
Google supports both page-level meta-tags and inline directives to help control how your
site's pages will appear in Google Search.
Page-level meta tags are a great way for website owners to provide search engines with
information about their sites. Meta tags can be used to provide information to all sorts of
clients, and each system processes only the meta tags they understand and ignores the rest.
Meta tags are added to the <head> section of your HTML page and generally
look like this:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<meta name="Description" CONTENT="Author: A.N. Author, Illustrator: P. Picture, Category: Books, Price:
Â£9.24, Length: 784 pages">
<meta name="google-site-verification" content="+nxGUDJ4QpAZ5l9Bsjdi102tLVC21AIh5d1Nl23908vVuFHs34="/>
<title>Example Books - high-quality used books for children</title>
<meta name="robots" content="noindex,nofollow">
</head>
</html>
Google understands the following meta tags (this list is not exhaustive):
Meta tags that Google understands
<meta name="description" content="A description of the page" />
Use this tag to provide a short description of the page. In some situations, this
description is used in the
snippet shown in search
results.
<meta name="robots" content="..., ..." />
<meta name="googlebot" content="..., ..." />
These meta tags control the behavior of search engine crawling and indexing.
The <meta name="robots"> tag applies to all search engines, while
the <meta name="googlebot"> tag is specific to Google.
In the case of conflicting robots (or googlebot) meta
tags, the more restrictive tag applies. For example, if a page has both the
max-snippet:50 and nosnippet tags, the nosnippet
tag will apply.
The default values are index, follow and don't need to be specified.
For a full list of values that Google understands, see the list
of valid directives.
You can also specify this information in the header of your pages using the
"X-Robots-Tag" HTTP header directive. This is particularly useful if you wish to limit
indexing of non-HTML files like graphics or other kinds of documents.

<meta name="google" content="nositelinkssearchbox" />
When users search for your site, Google Search results sometimes display a search box
specific to your site, along with other direct links to your site. This tag tells
Google not to show the sitelinks search box. Learn more about
sitelinks search box.
<meta name="google" content="notranslate" />
When Google recognizes that the contents of a page aren't in the language that the
user is likely to want to read, Google often provides a link to a translation in the
search results. In general, this gives you the chance to provide your unique and
compelling content to a much larger group of users. However, there may be situations
where this is not desired. This meta tag tells Google that you don't want us to provide
a translation for this page.
<meta name="google" content="nopagereadaloud" />
Prevents web browsers from reading aloud the tagged page using the Google Assistant
voice commands "Read this page" and "Read it."
<meta name="google-site-verification" content="..." />
You can use this tag on the top-level page of your site to verify ownership for
Search Console. Please note that while the values of the name and
content attributes must match exactly what is provided to you (including
upper and lower case), it doesn't matter if you change the tag from XHTML to HTML or
if the format of the tag matches the format of your page.
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="...; charset=..." />
<meta charset="..." >
This defines the page's content type and character set. Make sure that you surround
the value of the content attribute with quotes - otherwise the charset attribute may be
interpreted incorrectly. We recommend using Unicode/UTF-8 where possible.
More information.
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="...;url=..." />
This tag sends the user to a new URL after a certain amount of time, and is sometimes
used as a simple form of redirection. However, it is not supported by all browsers and
can be confusing to the user. The W3C recommends
that this tag not be used. We recommend using a server-side 301 redirect instead.
<meta name="viewport" content="...">
This tag tells the browser how to render a page on a mobile device. Presence of this
tag indicates to Google that the page is mobile friendly. Read
more about how to configure the viewport meta tag.
<meta name="rating" content="adult" />
<meta name="rating" content="RTA-5042-1996-1400-1577-RTA" />
Labels a page as containing adult content, to signal that it be filtered by SafeSearch
results. Learn more
about labeling SafeSearch pages.
Other points to note
Google can read both HTML and XHTML-style meta tags, regardless of the code used on the page.
With the exception of google-site-verification, letter case is generally not
important in meta tags.
This is not an exclusive list of available meta tags, and you should feel free to use
other meta tags if they are important to your site. Just remember that Google will ignore
meta tags that it doesn't know.
Inline directives
Independently of page-level meta-tags, you can designate parts of an HTML page not to be
used in snippets. This can be done with the data-nosnippet HTML attribute on
span, div, or section HTML elements. For example:
<p>This text can be included in a snippet <span data-nosnippet>and this part would not be shown</span>.</p>
To ensure machine readability, the section must be valid
HTML and all tags closed accordingly.
