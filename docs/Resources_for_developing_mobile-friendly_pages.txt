Resources for developing mobile-friendly pages
Users now browse the mobile version of a site as often (or more often) with a mobile device,
rather than browsing with a desktop computer. You should design your website to be viewed by
mobile devices.
Mobile devices generally fall into two classes: smartphones and feature phones. Smartphones
are essentially mini desktop computers with small screens, and include Android and iPhone
devices (we include tablet devices in this classification for design purposes). Feature phones
are less capable devices, and are handled differently by Google than smartphones.
For both types of devices:
The Google search results page is designed for the type of phone making the request
(feature or smart phone).
You can use App Indexing Search Preview to see what the page looks like on that phone type.
You can block a user agent specific to the mobile device type (smart or feature) in your robots.txt file.
PageSpeed
insights can analyze a page and provide tips for making the page load faster.

Resources and information for smartphone site developers
In selected countries, when Google detects a slow connection, Google automatically transcodes
pages that are linked to by search results. You can see what the page would look like using
the Low Bandwidth
Transcoder testing tool. Learn more.
The Mobile-Friendly
Test describes issues that can affect your page when accessed on a smartphone.
The Search Console mobile usability report describes issues that can affect your page when accessed on a smartphone.
The Chrome browser supports several smartphone layouts in the device mode & mobile emulator.
Resources and information for feature phone site developers
SERP and any pages linked by SERP are transcoded globally on any speed network unless either:
The page is already "feature-phone ready",
or
The page has a <link rel="alternate" media="handheld" href="alternate_page.htm" /> tag.
All images in SERP and any pages linked by SERP are resized unless user specifically opts out.
