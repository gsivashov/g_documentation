Resources for developing mobile-friendly pagesUsers now browse websites from a mobile site as often (or more often) from a mobile device as from a desktop computer. You should design your website to be viewed by mobile devices.
Mobile devices generally fall into two classes: smartphones and feature phones. Smartphones are essentially mini desktop computers with small screens, and include Android and iPhone devices (we include tablet devices in this classification for design purposes). Feature phones are less capable devices, and are handled differently by Google than smartphones.
For both types of devices:
The Google search results page is designed for the type of phone making the request (feature or smart phone).
You can use App Indexing Search Preview to see what the page looks like on that phone type.
You can block a user agent specific to the mobile device type (smart or feature) in your robots.txt file.
PageSpeed insights can analyze a page and provide tips for making the page load faster.

SERP and any pages linked by SERP are transcoded globally on any speed network unless either:
The page is already “feature-phone ready”,
or
The page has a <link rel="alternate" media="handheld" href="alternate_page.htm" /> tag.
All images in SERP and any pages linked by SERP are resized unless user specifically opts out.
