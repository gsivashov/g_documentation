paid links, malware, or other issues that might violate our
webmaster guidelines,
follow the appropriate link below to report the issue. While Google does not use these reports
to take direct action against violations, these reports still play a significant role in
helping us understand how to improve our spam detection systems that protect our search results.

Spammy content tries to get better placement in Google's search results by using various tricks
such as hidden text,
doorway pages,
cloaking, or
sneaky redirects. These
techniques attempt to compromise the quality of our results and degrade the search experience
for everyone.
