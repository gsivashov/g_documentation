Report spam, paid links, or malwareIf you find information in Google's search results that you believe appears due to spam, paid links, malware or other issues that might violate our webmaster guidelines, follow the appropriate link below to report the issue. While Google does not use these reports to take direct action against violations, these reports still play a significant role in helping us understand how to improve our spam detection systems that protect our search results.
Web page spam
Webspam pages try to get better placement in Google's search results by using various tricks such as hidden text, doorway pages, cloaking, or sneaky redirects. These techniques attempt to compromise the quality of our results and degrade the search experience for everyone.

Paid links spam
Buying or selling links that pass PageRank can dilute the quality of search results. Participating in link schemes violates the Googles Webmaster Guidelines and can negatively impact a site's ranking in search results.

Rich snippets spam
A rich result may be considered spam if it harms the user experience by highlighting falsified or misleading information. For example, a rich result promoting a travel package as an Event or displaying fabricated Reviews would be considered spam.
