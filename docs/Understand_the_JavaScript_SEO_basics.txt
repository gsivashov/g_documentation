Understand the JavaScript SEO basics
Do you suspect that JavaScript issues might be blocking your page or some of your content from
showing up in Google Search? Learn how to fix JavaScript-related problems with our
troubleshooting guide
JavaScript is an important part of the web platform because it provides many features that turn
the web into a powerful application platform. Making your JavaScript-powered web applications
discoverable via Google Search can help you find new users and re-engage existing users as they
search for the content your web app provides.
While Google Search runs JavaScript with an
evergreen
version of Chromium, there are
a few things
that you can optimize.
This guide describes how Google Search processes JavaScript and best practices for improving
JavaScript web apps for Google Search.
How Googlebot processes JavaScript
Googlebot processes JavaScript web apps in three main phases:
Crawling
Rendering
Indexing
Googlebot crawls, renders, and indexes a page.
Googlebot queues pages for both crawling and rendering. It is not immediately obvious when a
page is waiting for crawling and when it is waiting for rendering.
When Googlebot fetches a URL from the crawling queue by making an HTTP request it first checks
if you allow crawling. Googlebot reads the
robots.txt file. If it
marks the URL as disallowed, then Googlebot skips making an HTTP request to this URL and skips the URL.
Googlebot then parses the response for other URLs in the href attribute of HTML links
and adds the URLs to the crawl queue. To prevent link discovery, use the
nofollow mechanism.
Crawling a URL and parsing the HTML response works well for classical websites or server-side
rendered pages where the HTML in the HTTP response contains all content. Some JavaScript sites
may use the app shell model
where the initial HTML does not contain the actual content and Googlebot needs to execute JavaScript
before being able to see the actual page content that JavaScript generates.
Googlebot queues all pages for rendering, unless a
robots meta tag or header
tells Googlebot not to index the page. The page may stay on this queue for a few seconds,
but it can take longer than that. Once Googlebot's resources allow, a headless Chromium renders
the page and executes the JavaScript. Googlebot parses the rendered HTML for links again and queues
the URLs it finds for crawling. Googlebot also uses the rendered HTML to index the page.
Keep in mind that
server-side or pre-rendering is still a great idea because it makes your website faster for
users and crawlers, and not all bots can run JavaScript.
Describe your page with unique titles and snippets
Unique, descriptive titles and helpful meta descriptions help users to quickly identify the best
result for their goal and we explain what makes
good titles and
descriptions in our guidelines.
You can use JavaScript to set or change the meta description as well as the title.
Google Search might show a different title or description based on the user's query.
This happens when the title or description have a low relevance for the page content or when
we found alternatives in the page that better match the search query. See this page for more
information on titles and the description snippet.
Write compatible code
Browsers offer many APIs and JavaScript is a quickly-evolving language. Googlebot has some
limitations regarding which APIs and JavaScript features it supports. To make sure your code is
compatible with Googlebot, follow our
guidelines for
troubleshooting JavaScript problems.
We recommend using differential serving and polyfills if you feature-detect a missing browser API that you need.
Since some browser features cannot be polyfilled, we recommend that you check the polyfill documentation for potential limitations.
Use meaningful HTTP status codes
Googlebot uses HTTP status codes to find out if something went wrong when crawling the page.
You should use a meaningful status code to tell Googlebot if a page should not be crawled or
indexed, like a 404 for a page that could not be found or a 401 code for pages behind
a login. You can use HTTP status codes to tell Googlebot if a page has moved to a new URL, so
that the index can be updated accordingly.
Here's a list of HTTP status codes and when to use them:
HTTP status
When to use
301 / 302
The page has moved to a new URL.
401 / 403
The page is unavailable due to permission issues.
404 / 410
The page is no longer available.
5xx
Something went wrong on the server side.
Use meta robots tags carefully
You can prevent Googlebot from indexing a page or following links through the meta robots tag.
For example, adding the following meta tag to the top of your page blocks Googlebot from indexing
the page:
<!-- Googlebot won't index this page or follow links on this page -->
<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">
You can use JavaScript to add a meta robots tag to a page or change its content. The following example code shows
how to change the meta robots tag with JavaScript to prevent indexing of the current page if an
API call doesn't return content.
fetch('/api/products/' + productId)
.then(function (response) { return response.json(); })
.then(function (apiResponse) {
if (apiResponse.isError) {
// get the robots meta tag
var metaRobots = document.querySelector('meta[name="robots"]');
// if there was no robots meta tag, add one
if (!metaRobots) {
metaRobots = document.createElement('meta');
metaRobots.setAttribute('name', 'robots');
document.head.appendChild(metaRobots);
}
// tell Googlebot to exclude this page from the index
metaRobots.setAttribute('content', 'noindex');
// display an error message to the user
errorMsg.textContent = 'This product is no longer available';
return;
}
// display product information
// ...
});
When Googlebot encounters noindex in the robots meta tag before running JavaScript,
it doesn't render or index the page.
If Googlebot encounters noindex, it skips rendering and JavaScript execution.
Because Googlebot skips your JavaScript in this case, there is no chance to remove the tag from
the page.
Using JavaScript to change or remove the robots meta tag might not work as expected. Googlebot
skips rendering and JavaScript execution if the meta robots tag initially contains noindex.
If there is a possibility that you do want the page indexed, don't use a noindex
in the original page code.
Use long-lived caching
Googlebot caches aggressively in order to reduce
network requests and resource usage. WRS may ignore caching headers. This may lead WRS to use
outdated JavaScript or CSS resources. Content fingerprinting avoids this problem by making a
fingerprint of the content part of the filename, like main.2bb85551.js.
The fingerprint depends on the content of the file, so updates generate a different filename
every time. Check out the web.dev guide on long-lived caching strategies to learn more.
Use structured data
When using structured data on your pages,
you can use JavaScript to
generate the required JSON-LD and inject it into the page. Make sure to test your implementation to avoid issues.
Follow best practices for web components
Googlebot supports web components.
When Googlebot renders a page, it flattens the shadow DOM and light DOM content.
This means Googlebot can only see content that's visible in the rendered HTML. To make sure that Googlebot can still see your content after it's rendered,
use the Mobile-Friendly Test or the URL Inspection Tool
and look at the rendered HTML.
If the content isn't visible in the rendered HTML, Googlebot won't be able to index it.
The following example creates a web component that displays its light DOM content inside its shadow DOM.
One way to make sure both light DOM and shadow DOM content is displayed in the rendered HTML is to use a Slot element.
<script>
class MyComponent extends HTMLElement {
constructor() {
super();
this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });
}
connectedCallback() {
let p = document.createElement('p');
p.innerHTML = 'Hello World, this is shadow DOM content. Here comes the light DOM: <slot></slot>';
this.shadowRoot.appendChild(p);
}
}
window.customElements.define('my-component', MyComponent);
</script>
<my-component>
<p>This is light DOM content. It's projected into the shadow DOM.</p>
<p>WRS renders this content as well as the shadow DOM content.</p>
</my-component>
After rendering, Googlebot will index this content:
<my-component>
Hello World, this is shadow DOM content. Here comes the light DOM:
<p>This is light DOM content. It's projected into the shadow DOM<p>
<p>WRS renders this content as well as the shadow DOM content.</p>
</my-component>
Fix images and lazy-loaded content
Images can be quite costly on bandwidth and performance. A good strategy is to use lazy-loading
to only load images when the user is about to see them. To make sure you're implementing lazy-loading
in a search-friendly way, follow
our lazy-loading guidelines.
