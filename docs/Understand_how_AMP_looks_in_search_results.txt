Understand how AMP looks in search results
Google Search indexes AMP pages to provide a
fast, reliable web experience. When an AMP page is available, it can be featured on mobile
search as part of rich results and carousels. While AMP itself isn't a ranking factor,
speed
is a ranking factor for Google Search. Google Search applies the same standard to all
pages, regardless of the technology used to build the page. For more information on the
benefits of using AMP, see the
AMP Project success stories.
On mobile search, the AMP icon helps users quickly identify pages that load quickly and
smoothly. When users select an AMP page, Google Search retrieves the page from the
Google AMP Cache, enabling a variety of load optimizations that often
make these pages appear instantly, such as prerendering. Currently, AMP pages on desktop don’t
display with rich features (such as the AMP logo and carousels) and aren't served from the
Google AMP Cache/AMP Viewer.
Canonical AMP Pages behave
like standard results.
Initial display in Search results
The following table describes how your AMP content could appear in Google Search results.
To help Google better understand your page, you can add
structured data to your page. It's
important to note that Google doesn't guarantee that adding
structured data will enable a rich result in Search results. For more information, refer to the
Structured Data General Guidelines.
If you have duplicate pages for the same content, place the same structured
data on all page duplicates, not just on the canonical page. For more information on placement,
see the Structured Data General
Guidelines.

After users click AMP content
When users click your AMP content in Google Search, AMP content may be shown in one of two ways:
Google AMP Viewer: The default way your content is cached and served to
optimize the delivery of content for a better user experience. At the top of the Google AMP
Viewer, the domain of your content is displayed so that users understand who published
it.
Signed exchange: A technology that allows the browser to treat a document
as belonging to your
Origin.
About the Google AMP Viewer
The Google AMP Viewer is a hybrid environment where you can collect data about the user. Data
collection by Google is governed by Google’s
privacy policy. As an AMP page publisher
whose content is displayed in the Google AMP Viewer, your data collection is governed by your
privacy policy. Because you choose the behaviors and vendor integrations in your AMP page, you
are responsible for fulfilling the compliance obligations that result from those choices.
About signed exchange
A signed exchange allows you to use first party cookies to customize content and measure
analytics. Your page appears under your URL instead of the google.com/amp URL.
Google Search prioritizes linking to content as signed exchange over using the Google AMP
Viewer in browsers that support signed exchange. To provide users with results in this format,
you must publish AMP content as a signed exchange in addition to the regular AMP HTML format.
Currently, signed exchange is only supported in Google Search for rich results and basic
results, not carousels. To learn more about setting up signed exchange for AMP pages, visit
Serve AMP using Signed Exchanges.
