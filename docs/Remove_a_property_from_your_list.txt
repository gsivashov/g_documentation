Remove a property from your list To remove a property from your property list, open the property settings page of the property to remove and click Remove property. You can add a property back, as described below, but be aware of the following:
You will no longer receive notifications for the removed property.
If other verified property owners remain, the only effect is to remove the property from your list; other users will not be affected.
If you are the last verified owner of a property, all users or delegated owners of the property will lose access to the property in Search Console.
Re-add a removed property
You can re-add a removed property without the need for verification (as long as the property still has at least one verified owner). Learn more.
