Googlebot
Googlebot is the generic name for Google's
web crawler.
Googlebot is the general name for two different types of crawlers: a desktop crawler that
simulates a user on desktop, and a mobile crawler that simulates a user on a mobile device.
Your website will probably be crawled by both Googlebot Desktop and Googlebot Smartphone. You
can identify the subtype of Googlebot by looking at the
user agent string
in the request. However, both crawler types obey the same product token (user agent token) in
robots.txt, and so you cannot selectively target either Googlebot smartphone or Googlebot desktop
using robots.txt.
If your site has been converted to
mobile first
on Google, then the majority of Googlebot crawl requests will be made using the mobile
crawler, and a minority using the desktop crawler. For sites that haven't yet been converted,
the majority of crawls will be made using the desktop crawler. In both cases, the minority
crawler crawls only URLs that have already been crawled by the majority crawler.
How Googlebot accesses your site
For most sites, Googlebot shouldn't access your site more than once every few seconds on
average. However, due to delays it's possible that the rate will appear to be slightly higher
over short periods.
Googlebot was designed to be run simultaneously by thousands of machines to improve
performance and scale as the web grows. Also, to cut down on bandwidth usage, we run many
crawlers on machines located near the sites that they might crawl. Therefore, your logs may
show visits from several machines at google.com, all with the user-agent Googlebot. Our goal
is to crawl as many pages from your site as we can on each visit without overwhelming your
server's bandwidth. If your site is having trouble keeping up with Google's crawling requests,
you can
request a change in the crawl rate.
Generally, Googlebot crawls over HTTP/1.1. However, starting November 2020, Googlebot may
crawl sites that may benefit from it over
HTTP/2 if it's supported
by the site. This may save computing resources (for example, CPU, RAM) for the site and
Googlebot, but otherwise it doesn't affect indexing or ranking of your site.
To opt out from crawling over HTTP/2, instruct the server that's hosting your site to respond
with a 421 HTTP status code when Googlebot attempts to crawl your site over HTTP/2. If that's
not feasible, you
can send a message to the Googlebot team
(however this solution is temporary).
Blocking Googlebot from visiting your site
It's almost impossible to keep a web server secret by not publishing links to it. For
example, as soon as someone follows a link from your "secret" server to another web server,
your "secret" URL may appear in the referrer tag and can be stored and published by the other
web server in its referrer log. Similarly, the web has many outdated and broken links.
Whenever someone publishes an incorrect link to your site or fails to update links to reflect
changes in your server, Googlebot will try to crawl an incorrect link from your site.
If you want to prevent Googlebot from crawling content on your site, you have a
number of options. Be aware
of the difference between preventing Googlebot from crawling a page, preventing Googlebot from
indexing a page, and preventing a page from being accessible at all by both crawlers or users.
Verifying Googlebot
Before you decide to block Googlebot, be aware that the user-agent string used by Googlebot
is often spoofed by other crawlers. It's important to verify that a problematic request
actually comes from Google. The best way to verify that a request actually comes from
Googlebot is to
use a reverse DNS lookup
on the source IP of the request.
Googlebot and all respectable search engine bots will respect the directives in robots.txt,
but some nogoodniks and spammers do not. Google actively fights spammers; if you notice spam
pages or sites in Google Search results, you can
report spam to Google.
