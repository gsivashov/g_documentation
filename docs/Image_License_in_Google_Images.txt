Image License in Google Images
When you specify license information for the images on your website, the image can display with
a Licensable badge on image thumbnails in Google Images. This tells people that license
information is available for the image, and provides a link to the license in the Image Viewer,
which offers more detail on how someone can use the image.

information? Visit Image
Rights Metadata in Google Images.
Feature availability
This feature is available on mobile and desktop, and in all regions and languages that Google Search is available.
Prepare your web pages and images
To make sure Google can discover and index your images:
Make sure people can access and view your pages that contain images without needing an account or logging in.
Make sure Googlebot can access your pages that contain images (meaning, your pages aren't disallowed by a robots.txt file or robots meta tag). You can see all pages blocked on your site in the Index Coverage report, or test a specific page using the URL Inspection tool.
To learn more about how to use the URL Inspection tool, watch the Search Console training video.
Follow the Webmaster
Guidelines to make sure Google can discover your content.
Follow the Google
Images best practices.
To keep Google informed of changes, we recommend that you
submit a
sitemap. You can automate this with the
Search Console Sitemap
API.
Add structured data or IPTC photo metadata
To tell Google which images are licensable, add structured data or IPTC photo metadata to each
licensable image on your site. If you have the same image on multiple pages, add structured data
or IPTC photo metadata to each image on each page that it appears.
There are two ways that you can add license information to your image. You only need to provide
Google with one form of information to be eligible for the Licensable badge, and any of the
following methods is sufficient:
Structured data: Structured data is an association between
the image and the page where it appears with the mark up. You need to add structured data for
every instance an image is used, even if it's the same image.
IPTC photo metadata: IPTC photo metadata is embedded
into the image itself, and the image and metadata can move from page to page while still
staying intact. You only need to embed IPTC photo metadata once per image.
Note: If you choose to use both IPTC photo metadata and structured
data, and if any information conflicts between the two, Google will use the structured data
information.
The following diagram shows how license information may show up in Google Images:
A URL to a page that describes the license governing an image's use. Specify this
information with the Schema.org license property or the IPTC Web Statement of
Rights field.
A URL to a page that describes where the user can find information on how to license that
image. Specify this information with the Schema.org acquireLicensePage property
or the IPTC Licensor URL (of a Licensor) field.
Structured data
One way to tell Google that an image is licensable is to add structured data fields. Structured
data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page
content. If you're new to structured data, you can learn more about
how structured data works.
Here's an overview of how to build, test, and release structured data. For a step-by-step guide
on how to add structured data to a web page, check out the
structured
data codelab.
Add the required properties. For information
about where to put structured data on the page, watch
JSON-LD structured
data: Where to insert on the page.
Follow the General structured data guidelines.
Validate your code using the
Rich Results Test.
Deploy a few pages that include your structured data and use the URL Inspection tool
to test how Google sees the page. Be sure that your page is accessible to Google and not
blocked by a robots.txt file, the noindex tag, or login requirements. If the page
looks okay, you can
ask Google to
recrawl your URLs.
Note: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it
may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
To keep Google informed of future changes, we recommend that you
submit a
sitemap. You can automate this with the
Search Console Sitemap
API.

Structured data type definitions
The full definition of ImageObject is provided on
schema.org/ImageObject.
If you're using structured data to specify a licensable image, you must include the license
property for your image to be eligible to be shown with the Licensable badge. We recommend that
you also add the acquireLicensePage property if you have that information.
Required properties
contentUrl
URL
A URL to the actual image content. Google uses contentUrl to determine which
image the license applies to.
Note: Google also supports the url property to
specify the image URL if you don't include contentUrl.
While the url
property is not as precise and we recommend you use contentUrl instead, existing
markup may still use url.
license
URL
A URL to a page that describes the license governing an image's use. For example, it
could be the terms and conditions that you have on your website. Where applicable, it
could also be a Creative Commons License (for example,
BY-NC 4.0).
Recommended properties
acquireLicensePage
URL
A URL to a page where the user can find information on how to license that image. Here
are some examples:
A check-out page for that image where the user can select specific resolutions or usage rights
A general page that explains how to contact you
IPTC photo metadata
Alternatively, you can embed
IPTC
photo metadata directly inside an image. You must include the Web Statement of Rights
field for your image to be eligible to be shown with the licensable badge. We recommend that
you also add the Licensor URL field if you have that information.
Required properties
Web Statement of Rights
A URL to a page that describes the license governing an image's use, and optionally other
rights information. For example, it could be the terms and conditions that you have on
your website. Where applicable, it could also be a Creative Commons License (for example,
BY-NC 4.0).
Recommended properties
Licensor URL
A URL to a page where the user can find information on how to license that image. The
Licensor URL must
be a property of a Licensor object,
not a property of the image object.
Here are some examples:
A check-out page for that image where the user can select specific resolutions
A general page that explains how to contact you
Monitor rich results with Search Console
Search Console is a tool that helps you monitor how your pages perform in Google Search.
You don't have to sign up for Search Console to be included in Google Search results,
but it can help you understand and improve how Google sees your site. We
recommend checking Search Console in the following cases:
After deploying structured data for the first time
After releasing new templates or updating your code
Analyzing traffic periodically
After deploying structured data for the first time
After Google has indexed your pages, look for issues using the relevant
Rich result status report.
Ideally you should see an increase of valid pages, and no increase in errors or warnings. If you find issues
in your structured data:
Fix the errors.
Inspect a live URL to check if the issue persists.
Request validation using the status report.
After releasing new templates or updating your code
When you make significant changes to your website, monitor for increases in structured data errors and warnings.
If you see an increase in errors, perhaps you rolled out a new template that doesn't work, or your site interacts with the existing
template in a new and bad way.
If you see a decrease in valid items (not matched by an increase in errors), perhaps you are
no longer embedding structured data in your pages. Use the
URL Inspection tool to learn what is causing the issue.
Analyzing traffic periodically
Analyze your Google Search traffic using the Performance Report.
The data will show you how often your page appears as a rich result in Search, how often users click on it and what is
the average position you appear on search results. You can also automatically pull these
results with the Search
Console API.
Troubleshooting
Important: Google does not guarantee that structured data or IPTC
photo metadata will show up in search results. For a list of common reasons why Google may not
show structured data in search results, see the General
Structured Data Guidelines.
If you're having trouble implementing image license in Google Images, here are some resources
