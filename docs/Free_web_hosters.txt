Free web hosters
Free web hosting services can help to lower costs and technical barriers for webmasters,
enabling new site owners easily create their own websites. Unfortunately, spammers often take
advantage of these services to quickly and inexpensively create dozens or hundreds of sites
that violate our
quality guidelines and add
little or no value to the web.
Google makes a strong effort to take action only against individual spammy pages or sites.
However, in some cases, when the spammers have pretty much taken over much or all of the free
web hosting service, we may take action on how the free hosting service as a whole appears in
search results in order to prevent spam from being shown to our users.
If you have a free hosting service, here are some ways to reduce or prevent spam:
Tell users that you don't allow spam on your service
Publish a clear abuse policy and communicate it to your users, for example during the sign-up
process.
Block automated account creation
In your sign-up form, consider using
CAPTCHAs or
similar verification tools
to only allow human submissions and prevent automated scripts from generating a lot of sites
on your hosting service.
Monitor your service for abuse
Monitor your free hosting service for spam signals such as redirects, large numbers of ad
sections, certain spammy keywords, and large sections of encoded JavaScript code. The
site:
search operator or
Google Alerts are simple, free
tools that can help detect problems.
Keep an eye on your webserver log files for sudden traffic spikes, especially for newly
created sites.
Monitor your free web hosting service for phishing and malware-infected pages. For example,
you can use the
Google Safe Browsing API
to regularly test URLs from your service, or
sign up for Safe
Browsing alerts.
Come up with a few confidence checks. For example, if you're running a local Polish free web
hosting service, what are the odds of thousands of new and legitimate sites in Japanese
being created overnight on your service? A number of tools are available to detect the
language of newly created sitesâ€”for example
language detection libraries
or the
Google Translate API v2.
Identify spammy accounts
Keep a record of signups and try to identify typical spam patterns, such as:
Form completion time
Number of requests sent from the same IP address range
User agents used during signup
User names or other form-submitted values chosen during signup.
