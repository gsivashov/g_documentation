Install Client Libraries
The Indexing API is built on HTTP and JSON, so any standard HTTP client
can send requests to it and parse the responses.
However, the Google API client libraries provide better language
integration, improved security, and support for making calls that require
user authorization. The client libraries are available in a number of
programming languages; by using them you can avoid the need to manually set
up HTTP requests and parse the responses.
To get started, select the programming language that you are using for
development.

Installing the client library
You can either use a package manager or download and install the Python client library
manually:
Managed installation
Use pip or setuptools to manage your installation (you might
need to run sudo first):
pip (preferred):
$ pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client
Setuptools:
Use the easy_install tool included in the
setuptools package:
$ easy_install --upgrade google-api-python-client
Manual installation
Download the latest client
library for Python, unpack the code, and run python setup.py install
App Engine
Because the Python client libraries are not installed in the
App Engine Python runtime environment,
they must be
vendored into your application just like third-party libraries.
Ruby
This page contains information about getting started with the Indexing API using the Google API Client Library for Ruby. In addition, you may be interested in the following documentation:
Read the Getting started guide for the Google API Client Library for Ruby.

Installing the google-api-client gem
If you haven't installed the Google API Client Library for Ruby before, open a terminal and install using RubyGems:
$ gem install google-api-client
If you already have the gem installed and would simply like to update to the latest version:
$ gem update -y google-api-client
Depending on your system, you may need to prepend these commands with sudo.
