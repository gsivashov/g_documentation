Get videos on Google with schema markup
Does your video give users step-by-step guidance to make food or drinks?
Embed your video content within
Recipe structured data.
Or, does your video give users step-by-step guidance for some other task?
Embed your video content within
HowTo structured data.
Google Search is an entry point for people to discover and watch videos. While Google
tries to automatically understand details about your video, you can explicitly provide
information, such as the
description, thumbnail URL, upload date, and duration, by marking up
your video with VideoObject. Videos can appear in
Google Search results, video search results, Google Images, and
Google Discover.
Note: The actual appearance in search results might be different. You can
preview most features with the
Rich Results Test.
Based on how you mark up your content, your videos may also be eligible for the following video
enhancements:
Video enhancements
LIVE badge: Get a LIVE badge added to your video by marking your video with
BroadcastEvent. The LIVE badge can be applied to
any public video that is live-streamed for any length of time. Here are a few examples:
Sporting events
Awards shows
Influencer videos
Live streaming video games
Make sure you follow the LIVE badge guidelines and use
the Indexing API to make sure
Google crawls your page at the right time.
Home activities: Help people find activities to do at home. When people search for
activities to do at home, videos and online events appear in an immersive rich result. By
adding Video structured data, your videos may already be
eligible for this rich result, with no additional steps needed.
For more information
about feature availability, guidelines, and examples, see
Home activities.
Key moments
The key moments feature is a way for users to navigate video segments like chapters in a book, which can help
users engage more deeply with your content. Google Search tries to automatically detect the
segments in your video and show key moments to users, without any effort on your part. Alternatively,
you can manually tell Google about the important points of your video.
If your video is hosted on your web page, there are two ways that you can enable key moments:
Clip structured data: Specify the exact
start and end point to each segment, and what label to display for each segment.
SeekToAction
structured data (beta): Tell Google where timestamps typically go in your URL
structure, so that Google can automatically identify key moments and link users to those points within the video.
Beta: SeekToAction structured data is
currently in the beta phase of development, so that we can catch any bugs before
supporting the markup more broadly. We'll update this page when it becomes more stable,
and you're welcome to implement the markup on your own site in advance.
If your video is hosted on YouTube, you can specify the exact timestamps and labels
in the video description on YouTube. Check out the best
practices for marking timestamps in YouTube descriptions.
To opt out of the key moments feature completely (including any efforts Google may make to
show key moments automatically for your video), use the
nosnippet meta tag.
Video host carousel (limited access): Enable users to explore your video gallery
pages by adding ItemList structured data.
This feature is currently limited to a small set of providers. Google
Search may automatically show a host carousel for your site without you having to add
ItemList structured data.
How to add structured data
Structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page
content. If you're new to structured data, you can learn more about
how structured data works.
Here's an overview of how to build, test, and release structured data. For a step-by-step guide
on how to add structured data to a web page, check out the
structured
data codelab.
Add the required properties. For information about where to put
structured data on the page, watch JSON-LD structured
data: Where to insert on the page.
Follow the guidelines.
Validate your code using the
Rich Results Test.
Deploy a few pages that include your structured data and use the URL Inspection tool to test how Google sees the page. Be sure that your page is
accessible to Google and not blocked by a robots.txt file, the noindex tag, or
login requirements. If the page looks okay, you can
ask Google to
recrawl your URLs.
Note: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it
may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
To keep Google informed of future changes, we recommend that you
submit a
sitemap. You can automate this with the
Search Console Sitemap
API.

mobility with technology. Google Netherlands takes enormous pride in the fact that a
Dutch team worked on this innovation that will have great impact in their home country.

Guidelines
To help Google better understand your video, make sure you follow the guidelines:
Warning: If Google detects that some of the markup on your pages
may be using techniques that are outside our structured data guidelines, your site may receive
a manual action.
Webmaster guidelines
General structured data guidelines
Video best practices
Video sitemap guidelines
Livestream guidelines (if applicable)
Carousel guidelines (if applicable)
Clip and Seek guidelines (if applicable)
Best practices for marking timestamps on YouTube (if applicable)
LIVE badge guidelines
If you're adding BroadcastEvent to livestream
videos, follow these guidelines:
Don't use vulgar or potentially offensive language in the structured data.
To make sure Google crawls your livestream video at the right time, use the
Indexing API. Call the API for the
following events:
When the video goes live
When the video has stopped streaming, and the page's markup has been updated
to indicate the endDate
Whenever a change has happened in the markup and Google needs to be notified
The Indexing API only supports livestream videos.
Best practices for marking timestamps on YouTube
If your video is hosted on YouTube, Google Search may automatically enable key moments for your video based
on the video description on YouTube, and you may not have to mark specific timestamps in your
YouTube description. However, you can tell us more explicitly about the important points in
your video and we will prefer that information. The following diagram shows how timestamps and
labels in a YouTube video description can appear in search results:
1. Timestamp: When a clip starts.2. Label: The name of the clip.
Keep in mind the following guidelines when formatting timestamps and labels for YouTube descriptions:
Format the timestamp in the following format: [hour]:[minute]:[second]. If
there's no hour, you don't need to include it.
Specify the label of the timestamp on the same line as the timestamp.
Place each timestamp on a new line in the video description.
Link the timestamp to the specified point in the video.
Make sure the label contains at least one word.
List the timestamps in chronological order.
Clip and SeekToAction guidelines
If you're adding Clip or SeekToAction structured data to
mark video segments, follow these guidelines:
The video must have the ability to deep link into some point other than the start
point in the video URL. For example, http://www.example.com/example?t=30 starts
30 seconds into a video.
VideoObject structured data must be added to a page where users can watch the video. It's
a bad user experience to point users to a page where they can't watch the video.
The total video duration must be a minimum of 30 seconds.
The video must include the required properties that are listed in the VideoObject structured data documentation.
For Clip structured data only: Make sure that no two clips on the same video defined on the same page share a start
time.
For SeekToAction structured data only: Google must be able to fetch your video content files.
Structured data type definitions
This section describes the structured data types related to video features in Google Search.
You must include the required VideoObject properties for your
content to be eligible for display as a video rich result. You can also include the
recommended properties to add more information about your content, which could provide a better
user experience. In addition to VideoObject, you can add the
following data types to enable video enhancements in Google Search:
BroadcastEvent: Mark up livestream
videos to enable a LIVE badge on your video.
ItemList: Mark up pages with a list of videos
to enable a video host carousel.
Clip: Manually mark important segments in your video to help
users quickly navigate to specific points in a video.
SeekToAction: Enable key moments by indicating how your URL structure
works, so that Google can automatically identify key moments and link users to those points within the video.
Does your video teach users how to complete a task step-by-step?
Embed your video content within HowTo.
VideoObject
The full definition of VideoObject is available at
schema.org/VideoObject.
If you don't include the required properties, Google may not be able to extract
any information about the video. You can also include the recommended properties to
add more information about your content, which could provide a better user experience.
Required properties
description
Text
The description of the video. HTML tags are ignored.
name
Text
The title of the video
thumbnailUrl
Repeated URL
A URL pointing to the video thumbnail image file. Follow the thumbnail image guidelines.
uploadDate
Date
The date the video was first published, in
ISO 8601 format.
Recommended properties
contentUrl
URL
We recommend that you provide a URL to your video. You can provide a
URL by using one or both of the following properties: contentUrl and
embedUrl.
A URL pointing to the actual video media file, in one of the
supported
encoding formats. Don't link to the page where the video lives; this must be the
URL of the video media file itself.
Example
"contentUrl": "https://www.example.com/video/123/file.mp4"
Make sure to follow our
Video best practices.
Tip: You can ensure that only Googlebot accesses your
content by using a
reverse DNS lookup.
duration
Duration
The duration of the video in
ISO 8601 format.
For example, PT00H30M5S represents a duration of "thirty minutes and five seconds".
embedUrl
URL
We recommend that you provide a URL to your video. You can provide a
URL by using one or both of the following properties: contentUrl and
embedUrl.
A URL pointing to a player for the specific video. Don't link to the page where the
video lives; this must be the URL of the video player itself. Usually this is the information in
the src element of an <embed> tag.
Example
"embedUrl": "https://www.example.com/embed/123"
Make sure to follow our
Video best practices.
Tip: You can ensure that only Googlebot accesses your
content by using a reverse
DNS lookup.
expires
Date
If applicable, the date after which the video will no longer be available, in
ISO 8601 format. Don't
supply this information if your video does not expire.
hasPart
If your video has important segments, nest the required Clip properties in your VideoObject. For example:
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
"@context": "http://schema.org/",
"@type": "VideoObject",
"name": "Cat video",
"hasPart": {
"@type": "Clip",
"name": "Cat jumps",
"startOffset": 30,
"url": "http://www.example.com/example?t=30"
}
}
</script>
interactionStatistic
InteractionCounter
The number of times the video has been watched. For example:
"interactionStatistic":
{
"@type": "InteractionCounter",
"interactionType": { "@type": "http://schema.org/WatchAction" },
"userInteractionCount": 12345
}
Starting October 2019, we changed our documentation to recommend interactionStatistic instead of interactionCount. While we continue to support interactionCount, we recommend interactionStatistic moving forward.
publication
If your video is happening live and you want to be eligible for the LIVE badge, nest
the BroadcastEvent properties in your
VideoObject. For example:
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
"@context": "http://schema.org/",
"@type": "VideoObject",
"name": "Cat video",
"publication": {
"@type": "BroadcastEvent",
"name": "First scheduled broadcast",
"isLiveBroadcast": true,
"startDate": "2018-10-27T14:00:00+00:00",
"endDate": "2018-10-27T14:37:14+00:00"
}
}
</script>
regionsAllowed
Place
The regions where the video is allowed. If not specified, then Google assumes the video is
allowed everywhere. Specify the countries in
ISO 3166 format. For
multiple values, use a space or comma as a delimiter.
BroadcastEvent
To be eligible for display with a LIVE badge, nest the following
properties in your VideoObject. While
BroadcastEvent properties aren't required, you must add the following properties if you
want your video to display with a LIVE badge.
The full definition of BroadcastEvent is available at
schema.org/BroadcastEvent.
Required properties
publication
BroadcastEvent
Describes when the video is to be streamed live. Can be a list or a single instance.
publication.endDate
DateTime
Time and date of when the livestream ends or is expected to end, in
ISO 8601 format.
It is required to provide the endDate once the video has finished and is no
longer live. If the expected endDate is unknown prior to the livestream
starting, we recommend providing an approximate endDate.
If endDate is in the past or present, it indicates stream actually ended
and is no longer live. If endDate is in the future, it indicates stream is
scheduled to end at that time.
publication.isLiveBroadcast
Boolean
Set to true if the video is, has been, or will be streamed
live.
publication.startDate
DateTime
Time and date of when the livestream starts or is expected to start, in
ISO 8601 format. If
startDate is in the past or present, it indicates that the stream actually
started. If startDate is in the future, it indicates stream is
scheduled to start at that time.
ItemList (limited access)
To help Google better understand your video gallery pages, add the following ItemList
properties in addition to VideoObject properties. For more
information about carousels, see Carousel.
The full definition of ItemList is
available at schema.org/ItemList.
Required properties
itemListElement
ListItem
Annotation for a single item page. Each ListItem element should include
VideoObject properties as well as ListItem properties.
ListItem.position
Integer
Ordinal position of the item page in the list. For example:
"itemListElement": [
{
"@type": "VideoObject",
"position": 1,
... other VideoObject properties ...
}, {
"@type": "VideoObject",
"position": 2,
... other VideoObject properties ...
}
]
ListItem.url
URL
The canonical URL of the item page. Every item should have a unique URL.
Clip
To manually tell Google what timestamp and label to use for the key moments feature, nest the following properties in your
VideoObject. While
Clip properties aren't required, you must add the following properties if you
want Google to show the timestamps and labels that you specify for your video, instead of the
video segments that Google may automatically show for your video.
The full definition of Clip is
available at schema.org/Clip.
Required properties
name
Text
A descriptive title for the content of the clip.
startOffset
Number
The start time of the clip expressed as the number of seconds from the beginning of the
work.
url
URL
A URL that points to the start time of the clip.
The clip URL must point to the same URL path as the video with
additional query
parameters that specify the time.
For example, the following URL means the video starts at 2:00 minutes:
"url": "https://www.example.com/example?t=120"
Recommended properties
endOffset
Number
The end time of the clip expressed as the number of seconds from the
beginning of the work.
SeekToAction (beta)
To tell Google how your URL structure works (so that Google can display key moments
that are automatically identified for your video), nest the following properties in your
VideoObject. While
SeekToAction properties aren't required, you must add the following properties if you
want Google to understand how your URL structure works, so Google can link users to a point within the video.
If you prefer to identify key moments in a video yourself, instead
of letting Google automatically identify key moments, use Clip
markup instead of SeekToAction.
The full definition of SeekToAction is
available at schema.org/SeekToAction.
Required properties
potentialAction
SeekToAction
Indicates a potential action. Include the following nested properties
potentialAction.startOffset-input
potentialAction.target
For example:
{
"@context": "https://schema.org",
"@type": "VideoObject",
"potentialAction" : {
"@type": "SeekToAction",
"target": "https://video.example.com/watch/videoID?t={seek_to_second_number}",
"startOffset-input": "required name=seek_to_second_number"
}
)
potentialAction.startOffset-input
Text
The placeholder string that Google will identify as your timestamp structure and then
replace with the number of seconds to skip to. Use the following value:
"startOffset-input": "required name=seek_to_second_number"
potentialAction.target
EntryPoint
The URL of the page that contains this VideoObject, including a placeholder in the URL structure
that indicates where Google should insert the number of seconds to skip to in the video.
This is how Google understands your URL structure and how you format your timestamps.
Replace the timestamp part of the URL with the following placeholder
string:
{seek_to_second_number}
For example, replace the timestamp part of the URL:
"target": "https://video.example.com/watch/videoID?t=30"
So that the timestamp now looks like this:
"target": "https://video.example.com/watch/videoID?t={seek_to_second_number}"
Monitor rich results with Search Console
Search Console is a tool that helps you monitor how your pages perform in Google Search.
You don't have to sign up for Search Console to be included in Google Search results,
but it can help you understand and improve how Google sees your site. We
recommend checking Search Console in the following cases:
After deploying structured data for the first time
After releasing new templates or updating your code
Analyzing traffic periodically
After deploying structured data for the first time
After Google has indexed your pages, look for issues using the relevant
Rich result status report.
Ideally you should see an increase of valid pages, and no increase in errors or warnings. If you find issues
in your structured data:
Fix the errors.
Inspect a live URL to check if the issue persists.
Request validation using the status report.
After releasing new templates or updating your code
When you make significant changes to your website, monitor for increases in structured data errors and warnings.
If you see an increase in errors, perhaps you rolled out a new template that doesn't work, or your site interacts with the existing
template in a new and bad way.
If you see a decrease in valid items (not matched by an increase in errors), perhaps you are
no longer embedding structured data in your pages. Use the
URL Inspection tool to learn what is causing the issue.
Analyzing traffic periodically
Analyze your Google Search traffic using the Performance Report.
The data will show you how often your page appears as a rich result in Search, how often users click on it and what is
the average position you appear on search results. You can also automatically pull these
results with the Search
Console API.
Troubleshooting
Important: Google does not guarantee that features that consume structured data will
show up in search results. For a list of common reasons why Google may not
show your content in a rich result, see the General
Structured Data Guidelines.
If you're having trouble implementing or debugging structured data, here are some resources that
may help you.
If you're using a content management system (CMS) or someone else is taking care of your site,
ask them to help you. Make sure to forward any Search Console message that details the issue to them.
You might have an error in your structured data. Check the
list of structured
data errors.
Troubleshoot
missing rich results / drop in total rich results.
For general questions about crawling and indexing, check the
Google Search crawling and indexing FAQ.
Note: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it
may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
Ask a question in the Google Search Central office hours.
