In light of COVID-19, please review the latest announcement regarding the Reserve with Google guidelines for supporting users and merchants during this time. Additionally, since we are operating with a limited support team, it may take longer to connect with us. Thank you for your patience, and we value your partnership.

Starter integration overview
Do you manage a platform that provides appointment and reservation services for
restaurants and other businesses through a website or mobile app? If so, and
you'd like to let Google know so that we can consider your business for Reserve
with Google, fill out the
Reservations, appointments, online booking interest form.
Criteria
For a merchant to be eligible for this integration, they need to meet the following criteria:
The business must have a physical location with an address that we can match
to our Google Maps database.
Any action_link that you provide must point to merchant-specific pages
where the user performs an action. Actions include when a user reserves a
table, schedules a class, or orders food.
As we review new merchant verticals, we reserve the right to include or exclude
merchants as we see appropropriate.
Launch process
The process to launch your merchants on Reserve with Google is outlined in
Figure 1.
Note: Integration typically takes 2â€“3 weeks with dedicated technical resources.
