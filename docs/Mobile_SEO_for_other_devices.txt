Mobile SEO for other devices
Tablets
When thinking about how to configure your website for mobile users, it's common
to think about visitors using tablet devices to access your site. Although we
don't have specific recommendations for building search-engine-friendly
tablet-optimized websites, here are some tips for building websites that serve
desktop, smartphone, and tablet users.
Responsive Web Design
Our general recommendation is to use responsive web design. This means that your
website serves the same HTML code to all devices along with different CSS style
rules to optimize the site's interface on desktops, smartphones, and tablets.
If your website uses responsive web design, test it on a variety of tablets to
make sure it renders correctly as, just like for smartphones, there are a
variety of tablet sizes and screen resolutions.
Device-specific content
A website can return different pages (for example, different HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) for
different devices. These pages can be served on the same URL (a configuration
called dynamic serving) or on separate dedicated URLs.
If your website has different pages to serve desktop and smartphone users and
does not have tablet-specific pages, in our experience tablet users usually
expect to see your desktop site rather than the site's smartphone pages.
If your website has tablet-optimized sites, these guidelines can help you
configure your site:
Dynamic serving: Here the same URLs serves desktop, smartphone, and
tablet users by serving different HTML (and CSS) depending on the user agent.
As described in our smartphone website recommendations, we strongly suggest
using the Vary HTTP header.
Separate tablet-dedicated URLs: In this case, we strongly suggest that you allow
Googlebot to crawl the tablet URLs and use a rel="canonical" on each tablet
URL to point to the equivalent desktop URL.
Feature phones
Our recommendation for sites serving smartphone users is to use responsive web
design if possible. However, since feature phones don't have the capability to
follow CSS media queries, webmasters wishing to serve feature phones would need
to configure their sites to either use dynamic serving or separate URLs to serve
the feature phone content.
We also recommend that any page intended to support feature phones includes
the <link rel="alternate" media="handheld"> tag as described below.
This section demonstrates how to implement each of these configurations.
Dynamic Serving
Configuring your server to dynamically serve feature phone optimized contents on
the same URL that serves other devices uses the same implementation as when
serving smartphones. The server should include the Vary: User-Agent HTTP
response header, and you should also be aware of the common pitfalls when
detecting user agents. Additionally, on your page, include the following tag:
<link rel="alternate" media="handheld" href="[current page URL]" />
Separate URLs
Webmasters have three supported configurations when serving desktop, smartphone,
and feature phone users on different URLs. These configurations use the annotations
we've previously described for building feature phone and smartphone optimized sites.
Dedicated URLs configuration
In this configuration, the setup would be like this:
http://www.example.com/page-1 serves desktop requests
http://m.example.com/page-1 serves smartphone users
http://phone.example.com/page-1 serves feature phone users
In this configuration, we recommend to add the following annotations to help our
algorithms understand the relationship between the equivalent pages targeting
different devices:
On www.example.com/page-1 add:
<link rel="alternate" media="only screen and (max-width: 640px)" href="http://m.example.com/page-1" />
<link rel="alternate" media="handheld" href="http://phone.example.com/page-1" />
On m.example.com/page-1 add:
<link rel="canonical" href="http://www.example.com/page-1" />
On phone.example.com/page-1 add:
<link rel="canonical" href="http://www.example.com/page-1" />
Desktop and all-mobile URLs configuration
In this configuration, a website would serve desktop devices on one URL and all
mobiles (in other words, both smartphones and feature phones), on a separate URL. For example:
http://www.example.com/page-1 serves desktop users
http://m.example.com/page-1 serves both smartphone and feature phone users
In this case, the annotation on http://www.example.com/page-1 is the following:
<link rel="alternate" media="only screen and (max-width: 640px)" href="http://m.example.com/page-1" />
<link rel="alternate" media="handheld" href="http://m.example.com/page-1" />
On the m.example.com page, include the following tag:
<link rel="canonical" href="http://www.example.com/page-1" />
This rel="canonical" needs to be included regardless of if they are feature phone
pages or smartphone pages or not.
The server should include the HTTP Vary: User-Agent header in its response. This
sends a signal to Internet caches and Googlebot that the server's response may
differ depending on the user agent. Googlebot uses this signal for crawling.
Separate feature phone URLs configuration
In this configuration, a website serves desktops and smartphones on one URL using
responsive web design or dynamic serving, and feature phones on a separate URL.
For example:
http://www.example.com/page-1 serves desktop and smartphone users
http://m.example.com/page-1 serves feature phone users
In this case, the annotation on http://www.example.com/page-1 is the following tag:
<link rel="alternate" media="handheld" href="http://m.example.com/page-1" />
The annotation on http://m.example.com/page-1 is the following tag:
<link rel="canonical" href="http://www.example.com/page-1" />
Redirects and the Vary HTTP header
If your site automatically redirects mobile visitors coming to
the desktop site to the mobile site, or vice versa, be sure to configure
your server to include the Vary HTTP header.
Sitemaps
Our recommendations for using feature phone sitemaps and sitemaps for smartphone alternate URLs remain unchanged.
