Change page URLs with 301 redirects
If you need to change the URL of a page as it is shown in search engine results, we
recommend that you use a server-side 301 redirect. This is the best way to ensure that users
and search engines are directed to the correct page. The 301 status code means that a page has
permanently moved to a new location.
301 redirects are particularly useful in the following circumstances:
You've moved your site to a new domain, and you want to make the transition as seamless as
possible.
People access your site through several different URLs. If, for example, your home page
can be reached in multiple ways—for instance, http://example.com/home,
http://home.example.com, or http://www.example.com—it's a
good idea to pick one of those URLs as your preferred
(canonical)
destination, and use 301 redirects to send traffic from the other URLs to your preferred
URL.
You're merging two websites and want to make sure that links to outdated URLs are
redirected to the correct pages.
To implement a 301 redirect for websites that are hosted on servers running Apache, you'll
need access to your server's .htaccess file. (If you're not sure about your access or your
server software, check with your webhoster.) For more information, consult the
Apache .htaccess
Tutorial and the Apache
URL Rewriting Guide. If your site is hosted on a server running other software, check with
your hoster for more details.
