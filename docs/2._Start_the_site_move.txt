Move a site with no URL changes2. Start the site moveOnce the new site copy is working, you’re ready to moveNext: 3. Monitor trafficThe move process is as follows.
A. Remove any temporary blocks to crawling
While building the new copy of a site, some webmasters use a robots.txt file to disallow all crawling by Googlebot and other crawlers, or use noindex meta tags or HTTP headers to block indexing of content. Be sure to remove any such blocks from the new copy of the site when you’re ready to start the move.
B. Update the DNS settings
You start the site move by updating the DNS settings to point to the new hosting provider. Check with your DNS provider for how to do that. Because the DNS cache setting is cached, the setting takes some time to fully propagate to all users on the internet.
