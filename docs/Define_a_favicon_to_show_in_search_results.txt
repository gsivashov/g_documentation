Define a favicon to show in search results
If your site has a favicon, it can be included in Google Search results for your site:
Implementation
Here is how to make your site eligible for a favicon in search results:
Create a favicon that follows the guidelines below.
Add a <link> tag to the header of your home page with the following syntax:
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="/path/to/favicon.ico">
rel
Can be any of the following strings:
"shortcut icon"
"icon"
"apple-touch-icon"
"apple-touch-icon-precomposed"
href
The URL of the favicon. Can be a relative path (/smile.ico) or absolute path (https://example.com/smile.ico), but must be in the same domain as the home page.
Google will look for and update your favicon whenever it crawls your home page. If you make changes to your favicon and want to inform Google about the changes, you can request indexing of your site's homepage. Updates can take a few days or longer to appear in search results.
Guidelines
You must follow these guidelines to be eligible for a favicon next to your search results. Note that a favicon isn't guaranteed in search results even if all guidelines are met.
Both the favicon file and the home page must be crawlable by Google (that is, they cannot be blocked to Google).
Your favicon should be a visual representation of your website's brand, in order to help users quickly identify your site when they scan through search results.
Your favicon should be a multiple of 48px square, for example: 48x48px, 96x96px, 144x144px and so on. SVG files, of course, do not have a specific size. Any valid favicon format is supported. Google will rescale your image to 16x16px for use in search results, so make sure that it looks good at that resolution. Note: do not provide a 16x16px favicon.
The favicon URL should be stable (donâ€™t change the URL frequently).
Google will not show any favicon that it deems inappropriate, including pornography or hate symbols (for example, swastikas). If this type of imagery is discovered within a favicon, Google will replace it with a default icon.
