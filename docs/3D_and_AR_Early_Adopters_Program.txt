3D and AR Early Adopters Program
3D and Augmented Reality (AR) results help people view your 3D content directly from Google
Search results. If people tap the View in 3D chip, it takes them into an
immersive experience where they can interact with your 3D asset or even place it in their
space with AR. From this viewer experience, they can either tap a chip to continue to your
website or exit to the Google Search results page.
The following are examples of how, with this feature, people can interact with your content
in a more immersive way:
Product models for product pages
Popular characters or objects from media entertainment that come to life in 3D
Educational content that is more effectively understood in 3D
Feature availability
3D and AR in Google Search is available in all languages and countries where Google Search is
available.
Example
Here's an example that shows the entire flow from when a user views a 3D and AR
result to
when that user lands on a website. The pink bubbles indicate where a user taps on the
screen.
Understanding how 3D models work
This feature uses 3D models to allow a user to view objects in 3D and place them in their
space. A 3D model is an immersive media format that allows a user to zoom in, zoom out, and
rotate with limitless granularity to explore every angle of an object. 3D models differ from
video in that the user is in control of what angles of an object they see, where a video only
shows the angles that it captures. They differ from 360 panoramas in that they allow limitless
granularity when the user rotates and zooms, whereas 360 panoramas only allow the user to
rotate and zoom to preset angles.
3D models can be used with AR to allow a user to place a model of an object in their space,
which provides another level of immersion. While images can also be used with AR, they're 2D
and won’t provide the level of realism that a 3D model does.
3D model files store information about a model’s geometry, texture, and color and can also
include information about its scene and animations. The glTF and USDZ formats are used to
render a 3D model in real-time on mobile devices. To use this feature, you'll need to provide
us with at least one glTF file. There are hundreds of other formats such as FBX, OBJ, and
COLLADA, but these formats need to be converted to glTF or USDZ to render on mobile devices.
Express interest
To ensure the best experience for users, this feature is currently restricted to a limited
number of organizations. If you would like to participate,
