Review snippet
Are you here because you got a message from Search Console? Check our
troubleshooting resources.
A review snippet is a short excerpt of a review or a rating from a review website, usually an
average of the combined rating scores from many reviewers. When Google finds valid reviews or
ratings markup, we may show a rich snippet that includes stars and other summary info from
reviews or ratings. In addition to the text of the review, a rating is an evaluation described
on a numeric scale (such as 1 to 5). Review snippets may appear in rich results or Google
Knowledge Panels. You can supply ratings for the following content types (and subtypes):
Book
Course
Event
How-to
Local business
Movie
Product
Recipe
Software App
Google also supports reviews for the following schema.org types (and their subtypes):
CreativeWorkSeason
CreativeWorkSeries
Episode
Game
MediaObject
MusicPlaylist
MusicRecording
Organization
Does your site provide reviews from critics?
Use critic review structured data.
Does your site provide reviews about other employers? Use
Employer Aggregate Rating structured
data.
Does your site review claims made by others? Use
Fact check structured data.
Integrate with review snippets
Here's an overview of how to integrate with review snippets on Google:
Ensure that Googlebot can crawl your pages (meaning, your pages aren't protected by
a robots.txt file or robots meta tag).
Make sure you follow our guidelines.
Add structured data to your pages that have reviews.
If you’re just getting started, learn more about
how structured data works. You can
also try the
structured
data codelab, which walks you through how to add structured data to your website.
Test and preview your structured data.
Check the index status of your URLs and request for your URL to be
crawled with the
URL inspection tool in
Search Console. To confirm if crawlers are able to access structured data on your page, use
the Live Test feature.
Keep Google informed of new pages or
changes to existing pages.
Monitor how your reviews are performing in Search with the following Google tools:
Use the Performance
Report in Search Console to see how your reviews appear in Search results. You can automatically
pull these results with the
Search
Console API.
Use the Rich result status
report in Search Console to understand what Google could or could not read from your
site, and troubleshoot rich result errors.
Try it out
There are several ways you can add review structured data to a page:
Add a simple review.
Nest a review into another schema.org type using its
review property.
Add aggregate ratings. You can omit the rating for an individual review if your marked-up
content contains both an author and a review date. For aggregate reviews, you must supply
the average rating for the rich snippet to display.
Nest aggregate ratings into another schema.org type using its
aggregateRating property.
Simple review
Here's an example of a simple review that you can copy and paste to your own HTML
page.

Guidelines

Warning: If your site violates one or more of these guidelines,
then Google may take manual
action against it. Once you have remedied the problem, you can submit your site for
reconsideration.

General structured data guidelines
Technical guidelines
Make sure to mark up an aggregate evaluation of an item by many people with
schema.org/AggregateRating. Google may
display aggregate ratings as rich snippets or, for certain types of items, answers in
search results.
Refer clearly to a specific product or service by nesting the review within the markup of
another schema.org type, such as schema.org/Book or
schema.org/Recipe, or by using a
schema.org type as a value for the itemReviewed property.
Make sure the reviews and ratings you mark up are readily available to users from the
marked-up page. It should be immediately obvious to users that the page has review
content.
Provide review information about a specific item, not about a category or a list of
items. For examples, refer to the common
errors associated with list items.
If the review snippet is for a local business or an organization, you must follow these additional guidelines:
Pages using LocalBusiness or any other type of Organization
structured data are ineligible for star review feature if the entity being reviewed
controls the reviews about itself. For example, a review about entity A is placed on
the website of entity A, either directly in their structured data or through an
embedded third-party widget.
Ratings must be sourced directly from users.
Don't rely on human editors to create, curate, or compile ratings information for
local businesses; instead, use critic
review structured data.
Sites must collect ratings information directly from users and not from other sites.
Structured data type definitions
You must include the required properties for your structured data to display in search
results. You can also include the recommended properties to add more information to your
structured data, which could provide a better user experience.

The full definition of Review is available at
