Cross-language search resultsMatch user queries to pages in other languagesGoogle strives to make information accessible and useful to all users. This includes giving users the best results in their own language.
In cases where Google determines that there aren't enough high-quality and relevant results for a query in the user's language, Google Search results can include results from pages in other languages, with the title and snippet translated to the language of the user. Clicking one of these results sends the user to a live translation of the page by Google Translate. All further interaction with the page is through Google Translate, which will automatically translate any links followed. Google does not host any translated pages.
With cross-language search, users can now get the best results, regardless of their query language, and publishers can get more traffic and insights from users in fast-growing markets. This helps make more content available in more local languages, which benefits both users and publishers.
FAQs
Which pages are eligible for cross-language search results?
Pages are selected based on our analysis of where the biggest information gaps exist in various languages, and the quality and relevance of a candidate page to the user's query.
This means that if lots of high quality pages are already available in a certain language, then there is less need for cross-language search results to fill the gap. Cross-language search activates only when Google can't find a high-quality answer in the user's query language.
How do I enable this feature for my site?
Google is currently working with a small list of partner sites to match results into a few select languages. After this pilot phase, we hope to expand support for all publishers and many more languages.
Can I opt-out of cross-language search?
Currently this feature works only with a select group of invited partners, so there is no need to opt out. When the feature becomes generally available, there will be a mechanism for opting your pages out of this feature.
How is cross-language search different from the various translation options that Google already offers?
Without cross-language search results, a page likely won't appear prominently, if at all, for a query in another language, even if there are no high-quality and relevant results for that query in the user's language.
Can I monitor web and Search traffic for cross-language search results from my site?
Yes, you can. If your site is eligible for this feature, Google will provide information on how to monitor your traffic.
Can I control my snippet length in cross-language search results?
Yes--Google respects nosnippet, max-snippet, and all other search result display directives in cross-language search results.
Is this feature supported for both mobile and desktop?
Yes, cross-language search works on both mobile and desktop devices.
What is the behavior of the result page opened with Google Translate?
A page opened in Google Translate from a cross-language search result is no different than opening any other URL in Google Translate. This means that Javascript on the page is usually supported, as well as embedded images and other page features. Learn more about Google Translate.
What browsers are supported?
Any browsers that currently support Google Search should also support cross-language search results.
