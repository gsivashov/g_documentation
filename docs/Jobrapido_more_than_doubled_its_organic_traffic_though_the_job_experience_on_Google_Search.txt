About Jobrapido
Jobrapido is one of the global leaders for job search engines with more than 20 million unique job
postings every month and more than 80 million registered users. Being present in 58 countries,
Jobrapido’s mission is to revolutionize the way people get jobs.
Easy to integrate
Jobrapido decided to integrate with the job
experience on Google Search to attract more motivated applicants: “We know that job seeking is
a struggle and as a technology company, it is our duty to improve it the best way we can, with
minimum effort for job seekers. Jobrapido has always been one of the first companies to adopt
Google’s new services with the goal to constantly improve the user experience”, says Jean-Pierre
Rabbath, Jobrapido VP of Product. “In fact, adding the job markup for us was really easy and
allowed us to get the best of the job experience on Google Search rather quickly”.
Increased international traffic
Jobrapido has seen positive metrics and feedback from job seekers on their site across multiple
geographies. In Spain, Nigeria, and South Africa, the company’s overall organic traffic grew by
115%, and they have seen a 270% increase in new user registrations from organic traffic since launch of the new job experience on Google Search. Jobrapido also noted a 15% drop in user bounce
rate, which means the quality of the end user journey also increased.
“Integrating with the jobs experience on Google Search is a great way for us to easily increase
international traffic”, added Rabbath. “This is just the beginning for us, and we are looking
forward to the rollout of this search feature in other markets.”
