Welcome!
Mobile is changing the world. Today, everyone has smartphones with them, constantly
communicating and looking for information. In many countries, the number of
smartphones has surpassed the number of personal computers; having a mobile-friendly
website has become a critical part of having an online presence.
If you haven't made your website mobile-friendly, you should. The majority of
users coming to your site are likely to be using a mobile device.
If you don't know if your website is mobile-friendly, take the Mobile Friendly
Test now.

Why make a website mobile-friendly?
If not mobile-friendly, a site can be difficult to view and use on a mobile device. A non-mobile-friendly site requires users to pinch or
zoom in order to read the content. Users find this a frustrating experience and
are likely to abandon the site. Alternatively, the mobile-friendly version is
readable and immediately usable.
In the USA, 94% of people with smartphones search for local information on their phones.
Interestingly, 77% of mobile searches occur at home or at work, places where desktop computers are likely to be present.
Mobile is critical to your business â€“ whether
you're blogging about your favorite sports team, working on the website for
your community theater, or selling products to potential clients. Make sure that visitors can have a good experience on your site when they're visiting from their mobile devices.
How do I start?
The work involved in making a mobile-friendly site depends on your developer
resources, business model, and expertise. For an example of how a desktop site
might be redesigned to work on mobile, see the following diagram:
On a very basic implementation level, transitioning an existing
desktop site to mobile entails using existing sections of content from the
desktop site and organizing them in a mobile-friendly design pattern.
For more information on the technical implementation of a mobile site, see our docs on
Mobile SEO.
How much does it cost to build a site for mobile devices?
It varies. For example, here are some of the possibilities:
Going mobile can be free if you can
select a responsive template or theme for your website. A responsive
template or theme adapts the display to the visitor no matter if they are
using a desktop, tablet, or mobile phone.
Going mobile can be free if you have the technical skills to build your
mobile site. Check out Web Fundamentals.
Going mobile will likely cost time and money if you need to hire a developer.
Furthermore, if your website was created several years ago, a new developer
might recommend starting from scratch (so you'll be paying for a complete
makeover). This is because there are new web development techniques and
themes (or page templates) that may make it more efficient to re-do -- rather
than modify -- your site. This is especially the case for sites:
Built with Flash
Using outdated e-commerce platforms
The good news is that if you start from scratch there may be an existing
template or theme that you can utilize. You may be able to reuse your
existing content which can hopefully save time and money.
What are the next steps?
If your site was made by selecting a template or theme from third-party
website software, check out Customize Your Website Software for Mobile
Users, which can be the fastest way to become mobile-friendly.
