Follow our guidelines
To be eligible for inclusion in podcast features in Google Podcasts, you
must do the following:
Expose a valid RSS feed describing the podcast that conforms to the RSS
2.0 specifications and our feed
requirements.
Make sure the feed contains at least one episode that conforms to the
episode requirements.
Make sure the podcast has a
dedicated homepage that follows
our requirements. The homepage must have a <link> pointing to your
RSS feed.
Make sure Googlebot can access the homepage and the RSS feed. The homepage and the RSS
feed must not require a login, and must not be disallowed from crawling by the robots.txt or
noindex robots meta tag. We also recommend that Googlebot can access and crawl any audio
files within your RSS feed, though this is not required.
Make sure the podcast homepage follows the
Webmaster Guidelines.
If you want your podcast to appear in Google Play Music, your podcast must meet the
Google
Play Music podcast RSS feed specifications. The RSS specifications for Google Play
Music and Google Search are complimentary but not identical, so if you enable support for
one, you neither prevent nor enable support for the other.
