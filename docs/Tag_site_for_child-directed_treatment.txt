Tag site for child-directed treatment
If you think that your website or mobile app is intended specifically for children, visit the Tag for Child Directed Treatment page to tag a site or service that you would like Google to treat as child-directed in whole or in part for the purposes of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). If you have not already added a site to Search Console, you must first add the site and verify ownership.
Note that marking your site or app as child-directed does not affect its ranking in Google Search results.
Keep in mind the following:
You can tag an entire domain or portions of a domain (subdomain or subdirectory) for treatment as child-directed
Any pages beneath a domain or directory are also covered by the tag.
It may take some time for this designation to take effect in applicable Google services.
Google may limit the number of domains or sub-domains you may include at any time.
For finer control over how your content is treated, you can also tag individual ad units for treatment as child-directed. See the help center for your product to learn more about proper tagging.
Note: Tagging individual ad units has immediate effect on the ad served. An ad unit tag takes precedence over any applicable site-level settings.
