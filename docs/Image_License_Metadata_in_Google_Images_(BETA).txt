Image License Metadata in Google Images (BETA)
Note: This feature is in beta and subject to change. We're currently developing this
feature and you may see changes in requirements, guidelines, and how the feature appears in
Google Images.
When you specify license information for the images on your website, the image can display with
a Licensable badge on image thumbnails in Google Images. This tells people that license
information is available for the image, and provides a link to the license in the Image Viewer,
which offers more detail on how someone can use the image.

Feature availability
This feature isn't available in Google Images yet. You can provide metadata in advance, to
ensure your images are eligible when the feature becomes available.
Prepare your web pages and images
To make sure Google can discover and index your images:
Make sure people can access and view your pages without needing an account or logging in.
Make sure Googlebot can access your pages (meaning, your pages aren't disallowed by a robots.txt file or robots meta tag). You can see all pages blocked on your site in the Index Coverage report, or test a specific page using the URL Inspection tool.
To learn more about how to use the URL Inspection tool, watch the Search Console training video.
Follow the Webmaster
Guidelines to make sure Google can discover your content.
Follow the Google
Images best practices.
To keep Google informed of changes, we recommend that you
submit a
sitemap. You can automate this with the
Search Console Sitemap
API.
Add metadata
To tell Google which images are licensable, add metadata to each licensable image on your site.
If you have the same image on multiple pages, add metadata for each image on each page that it
appears.
There are two ways that you can add metadata. You only need to provide Google with one form of
metadata to be eligible for the Licensable badge, and any of the following methods is sufficient:
Structured data: Structured data is an association between
the image and the page where it appears with the mark up. You need to add structured data for
every instance an image is used, even if it's the same image.
IPTC photo metadata: IPTC photo metadata is embedded
into the image itself, and the image and metadata can move from page to page while still
staying intact. You only need to embed IPTC photo metadata once per image.
Note: If you choose to use both IPTC photo metadata and structured
data, and if any information conflicts between the two, Google will use the structured data
information.
The following diagram shows how license information may show up in Google Images:
A URL to a page that describes the license governing an image’s use. Specify this
information with the Schema.org license property or the IPTC Web Statement of
Rights field.
A URL to a page that describes where the user can find information on how to license that
image. Specify this information with the Schema.org acquireLicensePage property
or the IPTC Licensor URL (of a Licensor) field.
Structured data
One way to tell Google that an image is licensable is to add structured data fields. Structured
data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page
content. If you’re new to structured data, you can learn more about
how structured data works.
Here's an overview of how to build, test, and release structured data. For a step-by-step guide
on how to add structured data to a web page, check out the
structured
data codelab.
Add the required properties. For information
about where to put structured data on the page, watch
JSON-LD structured
data: Where to insert on the page.
Follow the General structured data guidelines.
Validate your code using the
Structured
Data Testing Tool.
Deploy a few pages that include your structured data and use the URL Inspection tool
to test how Google sees the page. Be sure that your page is accessible to Google and not
blocked by a robots.txt file, the noindex tag, or login requirements. If the page
looks okay, you can
ask Google to
recrawl your URLs.
Note: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it
may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
To keep Google informed of future changes, we recommend that you
submit a
sitemap. You can automate this with the
Search Console Sitemap
API.

Structured data type definitions
The full definition of ImageObject is provided on
schema.org/ImageObject.
If you're using structured data to specify a licensable image, you must include the license
property for your image to be eligible to be shown with the Licensable badge. We recommend that
you also add the acquireLicensePage property if you have that information.
Required properties
license
URL
A URL to a page that describes the license governing an image’s use. For example, it
could be the terms and conditions that you have on your website. Where applicable, it
could also be a Creative Commons License (for example,
BY-NC 4.0).
Recommended properties
acquireLicensePage
URL
A URL to a page where the user can find information on how to license that image. Here
are some examples:
A check-out page for that image where the user can select specific resolutions or usage rights
A general page that explains how to contact you
Note: You can start using the acquireLicensePage
property even though it's still under development on Schema.org.
IPTC photo metadata
Alternatively, you can embed
IPTC
photo metadata directly inside an image. You must include the Web Statement of Rights
field for your image to be eligible to be shown with the licensable badge. We recommend that
you also add the Licensor URL field if you have that information.
Required properties
Web Statement of Rights
A URL to a page that describes the license governing an image’s use, and optionally other
rights information. For example, it could be the terms and conditions that you have on
your website. Where applicable, it could also be a Creative Commons License (for example,
BY-NC 4.0).
Recommended properties
Licensor URL (of a Licensor)
A URL to a page where the user can find information on how to license that image. Here
are some examples:
A check-out page for that image where the user can select specific resolutions
A general page that explains how to contact you
Troubleshooting
Important: Google does not guarantee that structured data or IPTC
photo metadata will show up in search results. For a list of common reasons why Google may not
show structured data in search results, see the General
Structured Data Guidelines.
