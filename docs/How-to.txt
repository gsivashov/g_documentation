How-to
Does your page provide instructions for food or drinks? Add
Recipe structured data instead of HowTo.
Use HowTo structured data to explicitly tell Google that your content is a how-to. A
how-to walks users through a set of steps to successfully complete a task, and can feature video,
images, and text. For example, “How to tie a tie” or “How to tile a kitchen backsplash”. If each step
in your how-to must be read in sequence, it's a good sign that HowTo structured
data could benefit your content. HowTo structured data is appropriate when the how-to
is the main focus of the page.
Properly marked up how-to pages may be eligible to have a rich result on
Search and an Action on the Google Assistant, which can help your site reach the right users.
Adding HowTo structured data to your page can automatically
generate a How-to Action for smart displays.
If you'd like to provide your users with the best visual experience on these devices, including
the images specified in the markup, fill out the
interest form.
Feature availability
How-to rich results are currently available in all languages and countries where Google Search
is available. The feature is only available on mobile devices, not desktop.
Examples
Here are some examples of how your content may appear in How-to rich results. A more visual
variant may be displayed if your how-to contains an image of the completed how-to and an image per
step. Make sure to add as many required and recommended properties as possible
so your how-to can be most effectively represented in Google Search.

How to tile a kitchen backsplash
About
$100
About 2 days
Any kitchen can be much more vibrant with a great
tile backsplash. This guide will help you install one with beautiful
results, like our example kitchen seen here.
Necessary Items:
tiles
thin-set mortar
tile grout
grout sealer
notched trowel
bucket
large sponge
Preparation
Turn off the power to the kitchen and then remove
everything that is on the wall, such as outlet covers, switchplates, and any other item in
the area that is to be tiled. Then clean the surface thoroughly to remove any grease or
other debris and tape off the area.
Plan your Layout
Lay out your tile horizontally below the wall where you’re going to
place it. This makes it easy to ensure that your pattern will fit in the space provided.
Also it helps you double check that you have enough tile and know exactly where each piece
will go.
Spread the mortar on a small section of the wall with a trowel. Thinset
and other adhesives set quickly so make sure to work in a small area. Once it’s applied,
comb over it with a notched trowel.
Add your tile to the wall
Place the tile sheets along the wall, making sure to add spacers so the
tiles remain lined up. Press the first piece of tile into the wall with a little twist,
leaving a small (usually one-eight inch) gap at the countertop to account for expansion.
use a rubber float to press the tile and ensure it sets in the adhesive. Repeat the mortar
and tiling until your wall is completely tiled, working in small sections.
Apply the grout
Allow the thin-set mortar to set. This usually takes about 12 hours.
Don’t mix the grout before the mortar is set, because you don’t want the grout to dry out!
To apply, cover the area thoroughly with grout and make sure you fill all the joints by
spreading it across the tiles vertically, horizontally, and diagonally. Then fill any
remaining voids with grout.
Then, with a moist sponge, sponge away the excess grout and then wipe
clean with a towel. For easier maintenance in the future, think about applying a grout
sealer.

Guidelines
For your page to be eligible for How-to rich results and a How-to Action for the Google
Assistant, you must follow these guidelines:
General structured data guidelines
Webmaster guidelines
Content restrictions policy
for Actions on Google
How-to content guidelines
Content guidelines
Advertising: Don't use HowTo structured data for advertising purposes.
Ineligible Content: How-to rich results may not be displayed if the content
is obscene, profane, sexually explicit, or graphically violent; or if it promotes dangerous or
illegal activities or has hateful or harassing language.
Source: All HowTo content must be visible to the user on
the source page. The how-to should be the main focus of the source page. Don't include more
than one HowTo for a certain page.
Materials and Tools: Add structured data to all materials and tools necessary
to complete the task.
Steps: Each HowToStep must include the entire contents of the
source step. Don't mark up non-step data such as a summary or introduction section as a step.
Step images: If the steps are best represented visually, ensure the images
in these steps are marked up for each HowToStep. Only mark up the instructional
step images that are specific for each step and don't use the same image in multiple steps for
the same how-to. Use the same images that correspond to the content on your page. Don't
use images that don't reflect the how-to content, or use different images to optimize the
rich-result.
Final image: If the end result can be accurately described by an image,
ensure this image is present on the page, and your HowTo markup includes it using
the image property. This image may be the same as the one marked up for the last
step.
Content: Don't use HowTo markup for recipes. Recipes should
use the Recipe structured data
instead. Articles and general advice content that is not a specific set of instructions are not
appropriate for HowTo markup.
Structured data type definitions
You must include the required properties for your content to be eligible for display as a rich
result. You can also include the recommended properties to add more information to your structured
data, which could provide a better user experience.
To validate and preview your structured data, use Google’s
Rich Result Test .
HowTo
The full definition of HowTo is available at
schema.org/HowTo.
The HowTo type indicates that the page contains a how-to. There
must be one HowTo type definition per page.
Required properties
name
Text
The title of the how-to. For example, "How to tie a tie".
step
HowToStep or HowToSection
An array of HowToStep elements which comprise
the full instructions of the how-to. Each step element should correspond to
an individual step in the instructions. Don't mark up non-step data such as a summary or
introduction section, using this property.
For example:
You can specify the complete text for each step
by setting the text of each HowToStep. An image,
step-title given as name, and url are optional, but
recommended, since optional properties may contribute to a rich presentation of the search result.
