How Google crawls locale-adaptive pages
If your site has locale-adaptive pages (that is, your site returns different content
based on the perceived country or preferred language of the visitor), Google might not crawl,
index, or rank all your content for different locales. This is because the default IP
addresses of the Googlebot crawler appear to be based in the USA. In addition, the crawler
sends HTTP requests without setting Accept-Language in the request header.
IMPORTANT: We recommend using separate locale URL
configurations and annotating them with rel="alternate"
hreflang annotations.
Geo-distributed crawling
Googlebot crawls with IP addresses based outside the USA, in addition to the US-based IP addresses.
As we have always recommended, when Googlebot appears to come from a certain country, treat
it like you would treat any other user from that country. This means that if you block
USA-based users from accessing your content, but allow visitors from Australia to see it,
your server should block a Googlebot that appears to be coming from the USA, but allow access
to a Googlebot that appears to come from Australia.
Other considerations
Googlebot uses the same user agent string for all crawling configurations. Learn more about
the user agent strings used
by Google crawlers.
You can verify Googlebot
geo-distributed crawls using reverse DNS lookups.
Make sure that your site applies the robots exclusion protocol consistently for
every locale. This means that robots meta tags and the robots.txt file should
specify the same directives in each locale.
