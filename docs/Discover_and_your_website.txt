Discover and your website
Discover
shows users content related to their interests, based on their
Web & App Activity.
How Discover is different from Search
With Search, users enter a search term to find helpful information related to their query, but
Discover takes a different approach. Instead of showing results in response to a query,
Discover surfaces content primarily based on what Google's automated systems believe to be a
good match with a user's interests.
As a highly personalized feed, Discover actively tunes itself to a user’s interests and
displays content that aligns with those interests. The content in Discover is automatically
refreshed as new content is published, however Discover is designed to show all types of
helpful content from across the web, not just newly published content.
We are always improving Discover to serve personalized, helpful content to users. Given the
serendipitous nature of Discover, traffic from Discover is less predictable or dependable when
compared to Search, and should be considered supplemental to your Search traffic. Our ongoing
work to improve Discover’s user experience means sites may see changes in their traffic
unrelated to the quality or publishing frequency of their content.
How content appears in Discover
Content is automatically eligible to appear in Discover if it is indexed by Google and meets
Discover's content
policies. No special tags or structured data are required. Please note that being
eligible to appear in Discover is not a guarantee of appearing.
Our automated systems surface content in Discover from sites that have many individual pages
that demonstrate expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness (E-A-T). Those looking to
improve E-A-T can consider some of the same questions
we encourage site owners to consider for Search. While Search and Discover are different, the
overall principles for E-A-T as it applies to content within them are similar.
To increase the likelihood of your content appearing in Discover, we recommend the following:
Use page titles that capture the essence of the content, but in a non-clickbait
fashion.
Include compelling, high-quality images in your content, especially large images that
are more likely to generate visits from Discover. Large images need to be at least 1200 px
wide and enabled by the max-image-preview:large
setting, or by using AMP.
Avoid using a site logo as your image.
Avoid tactics to artificially inflate engagement by using misleading or exaggerated
details in preview content (title, snippets, or images) to increase appeal, or by withholding
crucial information required to understand what the content is about.
Avoid tactics that manipulate appeal by catering to morbid curiosity, titillation, or
outrage.
Provide content that's timely for current interests, tells a story well, or provides unique
insights.
To deliver a good user experience, Discover seeks to present content that's suitable for
interest-based feeds, such as articles and videos, as well as filter out content
that's not desired or that might confuse readers. For example, Discover might not
recommend job applications, petitions, forms, code repositories, or satirical
content without any context.
Monitor your performance on Discover
If you have content on Discover, you can monitor your performance using the
Performance
report for Discover. This report shows impressions, clicks, and CTR for any of your
content that has appeared in on Discover in the last 16 months, as long as your data reaches
a minimum threshold of impressions. We’ve recently added traffic from Chrome to the Discover
performance report, and now this report fully tracks a site’s Discover traffic across all
surfaces where users interact with Discover.
