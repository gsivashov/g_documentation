Data anomalies in Search ConsoleWhat's up with my graph?On rare occasions, there might be an event in Search Console that could affect your report data. For example, if we change our data aggregation methods or there is a logging error, you might see a dip or bump in your chart. This page records known issues that might affect your data.
Product-wide notes
April 12, 2020 onward
AMP, Mobile Usability, Speed, all rich result reports
These reports have been changed to cover a smaller number of pages, in order to provide better performance in Search Console. Because of this, you might see a decrease in the number of items and pages tracked in these reports. This change does not affect Search results, only the data reporting in Search Console.
April 9-25, 2019
Search Console experienced a data outage that ceased on April 26. The outage affected all reports except the Performance report. All missing data from April 9-25 was replaced with the data from April 26, when data began to be available again.
Remove URLs Report
No issues.
URL Inspection tool
2020
October 14, ongoing
The "Request Indexing" feature of the URL Inspection Tool has been disabled in order to make some technical updates. We expect it to be re-enabled in the coming weeks. In the meanwhile, Google continues to find and index content through our regular methods, as covered here.
Performance reports (Search Results / Discover)
October 28 (Discover)
A previous issue in which some Discover data were mis-classified as video in the Performance report has been fixed. Because of this, you may see a drop in your Discover report's video appearance statistics. This mis-classification did not affect Discover results for users, only the data reporting.
October 6, ongoing (Discover)
Following the launch of the Stories carousel feature on Discover, you might see a significant increase in Web Story stats on Discover reporting for your site.
September 25-28 (Discover)
Web Stories were shown less often to Discover users during this period, so you will see a drop in impressions and clicks for this type in the Performance report for Discover.
May 12-15 (Discover)
Due to internal logging issues, you might see a significant drop in Discover reporting for your site. Please note that this did not reflect any user-facing changes for your site, only the data reporting in Search Console.
2019
December 8-13 (Discover)
Because of an internal issue, you will see a data drop in the Performance report for Discover during this period. This issue has been fixed. Please note that this does not reflect any user-facing changes for your site, only the data reporting in Search Console.
November 14-19
Some image click data was dropped; as a result, you might see a dip in both click rate and CTR during this period. The issue has been fixed. This issue affected only Search Console reporting, not your performance on Google Search.
June 5-7
Some image search statistics were not captured during this period due to an internal issue. Because of this, you may see a drop in your image search statistics during this period. The change did not affect user Search results, only the data reporting.
February 6
All data from January 10, 2018 onward was converted to use canonical URLs.
2018
December 1 - December 3
Some data for clicks in Google Images from mobile devices was dropped. This change only affects Search Console reporting, not your actual performance on Google Search.
Crawl Status Report (Legacy report)
No issues.
Mobile Usability Report
April 12, 2020 onward
The report has been changed to cover a smaller number of pages, in order to provide better performance in Search Console. Because of this, you might see a decrease in the number of items and pages tracked in the report. This change does not affect Search results, only the data reporting in Search Console.
Index Coverage Report
Sept 1, 2020 ongoing
An internal systems error caused a delay in processing index coverage information. No data has been lost, and the report will show accurate data after processing is complete.
December 15, 2019 onward
The Index Coverage report can now more accurately report on indexed pages. Because of this, some pages that were Crawled - currently not indexed are now known to be indexed. As a result, you may see a transfer of pages from Excluded to Valid state. This does not reflect any changes in your site, but a more accurate accounting system.
International Targeting Report
No issues
AMP enhancement report
August 18, 2020 onward
The report has been updated to include Signed Exchange related issues.  This change does not affect Search results, only the data reporting in Search Console. Read more.
April 12, 2020 onward
The report has been changed to cover a smaller number of pages, in order to provide better performance in Search Console.

January 23, 2019
Some users may see elevated error levels of type "Crawl Issue" on their AMP URLs due to a processing error on our side. The issue is now fixed and error counts should return to their actual levels within few days
Rich result reports
August 26, 2020
Dataset
Search Console began marking as "warning" any Dataset object that is missing the recommended property creator. Therefore you may see an increase in warnings for Dataset instances on your website.
July 1, 2020 onward
Video
Search Console began marking as "warning" any Video object that is missing both embedUrl and contentUrl properties. This is not a change in requirements or behavior, but an improvement in our reporting system to better reflect the actual indexing behavior. Video objects that are missing both embedUrl and contentUrl properties can still appear as rich results but additional content based features of videos such as animated previews and key moments may not work. Therefore you might see an increase in warnings in Video items on your site. To fix this issue, define either of these two properties in your Video object. (Note that this does not affect Video items embedded within other types, such as Video within Recipe.)
April 29, 2020 onward
Event
A new, optional property "Organizer" was introduced for Event items. Previously valid Event items might be labeled warning if you do not use this new properties, or error if you incorrectly defined it.
April 12, 2020 onward
All rich result types
These reports have been changed to cover a smaller number of pages, in order to provide better performance in Search Console. Because of this, you might see a decrease in the number of items and pages tracked in these reports. This change does not affect Search results, only the data reporting in Search Console.
March 19, 2020 onward
Event
New optional event properties and property values for virtual and canceled events were introduced. If you previously had a valid event, it might show valid with warnings if you do not use these new properties, or error if you incorrectly define these new properties.
January 21, 2020 onward
All rich result types
Starting April 6, 2020, Google will no longer support data-vocabulary.org structured data to enable rich results in Google Search. From January 20 until April 6, any data-vocabulary.org structured data on a web page will trigger a warning for the appropriate rich result type. After April 6, an error will be triggered. Read the Webmaster Central Blog posting for more background and detail.
January 13-16, 2020
Unparsable structured data
Some users may see a spike in unparsable structured data errors. This was due to an internal misconfiguration that will be fixed soon, and can be ignored.
December 3, 2019 onward
All rich result types
Rich results implemented with RDFa or microdata that incorrectly tag a URL where a text value is expected are now shown as an error in the rich result report. The most common case is pages that incorrectly label <a href=...> tags with itemprop, expecting the text content of the <a> tag to be used, when in fact the href value will be used. A correct implementation in this case would use a nested <span itemprop> tag inside the <a> tag, where the <span> contains the non-URL value.
December 10, 2019 onward
Job Postings
Search Console now reports more specific error types of Job Posting errors. Therefore you might see a reduction in certain generic error types, with a corresponding increase in new, more specific error types (if you have not already fixed those issues). The total number of errors should not change as a result of this update.
October 16, 2019 onward
Product
Search Console improved its error detection pipeline for Product structured data. Product items are now validated wherever they occur in a structured data tree rather than just at the top level. This may cause errors or warnings to appear on pages that were previously shown as valid.
September 26, 2019 onward
Breadcrumb
Google fixed an error in Breadcrumb validation (the last crumb in the chain does not, in fact, require an explicit URL target). As a result, you may see a reduction in errors in your Breadcrumbs report going forward.
August 13, 2019 onward
Product, Sitelink Searchbox, Unparsable types
Some new issue types have been added to these rich result reports. The ability to report on these issues is new; the issues reported may or may not be new.
