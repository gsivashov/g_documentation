Data anomalies in Search ConsoleWhat's up with my graph?On rare occasions, there might be an event in Search Console that could affect your report data. For example, if we change our data aggregation methods or there is a logging error, you might see a dip or bump in your chart. This page records known issues that might affect your data.
Product-wide notes
April 9-25, 2019
Search Console experienced a data outage that ceased on April 26. The outage affected all reports except the Performance report. All missing data from April 9-25 was replaced with the data from April 26, when data began to be available again.
April 5, 2019
Because of internal management of our Search index, some pages of your websites might have been dropped from our index for a period of a few days without any action on your part. The matter has been resolved, no further action from your side is needed.
April 3, 2019
For most enhancement reports, data is now being collected from more pages than previously reported. Because of this, you might see an increase in issues and affected items/pages on these reports.
Remove URLs Report
No issues.
Performance report (Search Results / Discover)
2019
December 8-13, 2019 (Discover)
Because of an internal issue, you will see a data drop in the Performance report for Discover during this period. This issue has been fixed. Please note that this does not reflect any user-facing changes for your site, only the data reporting in Search Console.
November 14-19
Some image click data was dropped; as a result, you might see a dip in both click rate and CTR during this period. The issue has been fixed. This issue affected only Search Console reporting, not your performance on Google Search.
June 5-7
Some image search statistics were not captured during this period due to an internal issue. Because of this, you may see a drop in your image search statistics during this period. The change did not affect user Search results, only the data reporting.
February 6
All data from January 10, 2018 onward was converted to use canonical URLs.
2018
December 1 - December 3
Some data for clicks in Google Images from mobile devices was dropped. This change only affects Search Console reporting, not your actual performance on Google Search.
Crawl Status Report (Legacy report)
No issues.
Mobile Usability Report
No issues
Index Coverage Report
December 15, 2019 onward
The Index Coverage report can now more accurately report on indexed pages. Because of this, some pages that were Crawled - currently not indexed are now known to be indexed. As a result, you may see a transfer of pages from Excluded to Valid state. This does not reflect any changes in your site, but a more accurate accounting system.
International Targeting Report
No issues
AMP enhancement report
January 23, 2019
Some users may see elevated error levels of type "Crawl Issue" on their AMP URLs due to a processing error on our side. The issue is now fixed and error counts should return to their actual levels within few days
Rich result reports
March 19, 2020 onward
Event
New optional event properties and property values for virtual and canceled events were introduced. If you previously had a valid event, it might show valid with warnings if you do not use these new properties, or error if you incorrectly define these new properties.
January 21, 2020 onward
All rich result types
Starting April 6, 2020, Google will no longer support data-vocabulary.org structured data to enable rich results in Google Search. From January 20 until April 6, any data-vocabulary.org structured data on a web page will trigger a warning for the appropriate rich result type. After April 6, an error will be triggered. Read the Webmaster Central Blog posting for more background and detail.
January 13-16, 2020
Unparsable structured data
Some users may see a spike in unparsable structured data errors. This was due to an internal misconfiguration that will be fixed soon, and can be ignored.
December 3, 2019 onward
All rich result types
Rich results implemented with RDFa or microdata that incorrectly tag a URL where a text value is expected are now shown as an error in the rich result report. The most common case is pages that incorrectly label <a href=...> tags with itemprop, expecting the text content of the <a> tag to be used, when in fact the href value will be used. A correct implementation in this case would use a nested <span itemprop> tag inside the <a> tag, where the <span> contains the non-URL value.
December 10, 2019 onward
Job Postings
Search Console now reports more specific error types of Job Posting errors. Therefore you might see a reduction in certain generic error types, with a corresponding increase in new, more specific error types (if you have not already fixed those issues). The total number of errors should not change as a result of this update.
October 16, 2019 onward
Product
Search Console improved its error detection pipeline for Product structured data. Product items are now validated wherever they occur in a structured data tree rather than just at the top level. This may cause errors or warnings to appear on pages that were previously shown as valid.
September 26, 2019 onward
Breadcrumb
Google fixed an error in Breadcrumb validation (the last crumb in the chain does not, in fact, require an explicit URL target). As a result, you may see a reduction in errors in your Breadcrumbs report going forward.
August 13, 2019 onward
Product, Sitelink Searchbox, Unparsable types
Some new issue types have been added to these rich result reports. The ability to report on these issues is new; the issues reported may or may not be new.
