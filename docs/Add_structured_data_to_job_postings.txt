Add structured data to job postings
Due to COVID-19, Google has seen more job
seeker interest in work-from-home and remote job opportunities. We encourage you to
mark up your work from home jobs.
You can improve the job seeking experience by adding job posting structured data to your job
posting web pages. Adding structured data makes your job postings eligible to appear in a special
user experience in Google Search results. You can also integrate with Google by
using a third party job site.
Note: The actual appearance in search results might be different. Preview the structured data
in the Rich Results Test for the most up-to-date layout.
For employers and job content site owners, this feature brings many benefits:
More interactive results: Your postings can be eligible to be displayed in
the job search experience on Google, featuring your logo, reviews, ratings, and job details.
More, motivated applicants: The new user experience enables job seekers to
filter by various criteria like location or job title, meaning you’re more likely to attract
applicants who are looking exactly for that job.
Increased chances of discovery and conversion: Job seekers will have a
new avenue to interact with your postings and click through to your site.
Does your site provide salary estimates? Add Estimated salary structured data.
Does your site provide reviews about other employers? Add Employer Aggregate Rating structured data.

Build, test, release structured data
Structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page
content. If you’re new to structured data, you can learn more about
how structured data works.
Here's an overview of how to build, test, and release structured data. For a step-by-step guide
on how to add structured data to a web page, check out the
structured
data codelab.
Ensure that Googlebot can crawl your job posting web pages (not protected by a robots.txt file or robots meta tag).
Ensure that your host load settings allow for
frequent crawls.
If you have several copies of the same job posting on your site hosted under different
URLs, use canonical URLs
on each copy of the page.
Add the required and recommended properties. For information about where to put
structured data on the page, watch JSON-LD structured
data: Where to insert on the page.
Follow the technical guidelines and job posting content policies.
Validate your code using the
Rich Results Test.
You can also preview how your structured data may look on Google Search.
Deploy a few pages that include your structured data and use the URL Inspection tool to test how Google sees the page. Be sure that your page is
accessible to Google and not blocked by a robots.txt file, the noindex tag, or
login requirements. If the page looks okay, you can
ask Google to
recrawl your URLs.
Note: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it
may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
Keep Google informed by doing one of the following actions:
For job posting URLs, we recommend using the Indexing API instead of sitemaps because the Indexing API prompts Googlebot to crawl your page sooner than updating the sitemap and pinging Google. However, we still recommend submitting a sitemap for coverage of your entire site.
Use the Indexing API to notify Google of a new URL to crawl or that content at a URL has been updated.
If you're not using the Indexing API, submit a new sitemap to Google by sending a GET
request to the following URL:
http://www.google.com/ping?sitemap=location_of_sitemap
For example:
http://www.google.com/ping?sitemap=http://www.example.com/sitemap.xml
We ingest the entire sitemap and recrawl the pages with lastmod times that
are more recent than the last time those pages were crawled.
Remove a job posting
Jobs that are no longer open for applications must be expired in one of
the following ways. Failure to take timely action on expired jobs may result in a manual action.
To remove a job posting that is no longer available, follow the steps below:
Make sure your page is removed by doing one of the following actions:
Ensure the validThrough property is populated and in the past.
Remove the page entirely (so that requesting it returns a 404 or 410 status code).
Remove JobPosting structured data from the page.
Keep Google informed by doing one of the following actions:
For job posting URLs, we recommend using the Indexing API instead of sitemaps because the Indexing API prompts Googlebot to crawl your page sooner than removing the URL from the sitemap and pinging Google. However, we still recommend submitting a sitemap for coverage of your entire site.
Use the Indexing API to request removal of a job posting URL from the Google Search index.
If you're not using the Indexing API, submit a new sitemap to Google by sending a GET
request to the following URL:
http://www.google.com/ping?sitemap=location_of_sitemap
For example:
http://www.google.com/ping?sitemap=http://www.example.com/sitemap.xml
We ingest the entire sitemap and recrawl the pages with lastmod times that
are more recent than the last time those pages were crawled.
Mark up work from home jobs
Given the recent COVID-19 impact on businesses and employment, Google has seen
more job seeker
interest in work-from-home and remote job opportunities. To make it easier for job seekers
to discover these relevant employment options, we encourage you to add structured data to your
work from home jobs.
Here's how work from home jobs can appear in Google Search:
You can also try it out in Google Search:
search Work from home jobs
Feature availability: The actual appearance in search results might be
different, and you may not see work from home jobs appearing in your region right away. To make
your work from home jobs eligible for display in the feature, mark
up your work from home jobs in advance.
There are three properties that help Google understand which jobs
can be performed from home:
jobLocationType: Use this property to
specify that the job is a Work from home job.
applicantLocationRequirements:
Use this property to specify geographic location(s) in which employees may be located for
work from home jobs. At least one country is required.
jobLocation: Use this property to specify where
the job can be physically performed. You don't need to use this property if there isn't a
physical location where a job can be performed (for example, an office or construction
site).
Here are some common scenarios in which you should mark up work from home jobs:
The job can be performed at home, but there are geographical restrictions for
where the employee can be located. The employee doesn't have to go to a physical
job location or office. Use applicantLocationRequirements and
jobLocationType.
"applicantLocationRequirements": {
"@type": "Country",
"name": "USA"
},
"jobLocationType": "TELECOMMUTE"
The job can be performed at a physical work site located in Detroit, MI, or at home in
the US. Use jobLocation and jobLocationType.
"jobLocation": {
"@type": "Place",
"address": {
"@type": "PostalAddress",
"addressLocality": "Detroit",
"addressRegion": "MI",
"addressCountry": "US"
}
},
"jobLocationType": "TELECOMMUTE"
The job can be performed at a physical location in Detroit or at home in either
Michigan or Texas. Use jobLocation, jobLocationType, and applicantLocationRequirements.
"jobLocation": {
"@type": "Place",
"address": {
"@type": "PostalAddress",
"streetAddress": "555 Clancy St",
"addressLocality": "Detroit",
"addressRegion": "MI",
"postalCode": "48201",
"addressCountry": "US"
}
},
"applicantLocationRequirements": [{
"@type": "State",
"name": "Michigan, USA"
},{
"@type": "State",
"name": "Texas, USA"
}],
"jobLocationType": "TELECOMMUTE"
Update your company logo
Google uses the same logo for your job postings as the image shown in your company’s Knowledge
Graph card. You can suggest
a change if you prefer a different logo, or else indicate your preferred logo (for both your
company’s Knowledge Graph card and its job postings)
using structured
data.
Note: In most cases, Google will review your request within a few
days.
If you have a third-party job site, you can provide a different logo for a given organization
than the image shown in the organization's Knowledge Graph card. Google will pick the best logo
to display in Search results, whether it's the Knowledge Graph logo or the
hiringOrganization logo. The logo property is only eligible to be shown on your
job site, and isn't treated as the canonical logo for the organization. For more information,
see hiringOrganization.
Monitor performance in Search
You can understand how users interact with your job posting by using the following Google tools:
Use the
Performance Report in Search Console to show
job listing or detail
view data for a given job posting rich result. You can automatically pull these results with the
Search Console API.
Use our custom
UTM parameters to track impressions after a user is directed from the job detailed page to your
site. You can use the parameters with
Google Analytics
or other third-party tracking tools:
utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply
utm_source=google_jobs_apply
utm_medium=organic
If you're experiencing unexpected fluctuations or inconsistencies in your traffic, use the
troubleshooter to identify and resolve the issues.
Technical guidelines
Put structured data on the most detailed leaf page possible. Don't add structured data to
pages intended to present a list of jobs (for example, search result pages). Instead, apply
structured data to the most specific page describing a single job with its
relevant details.
Add a JobPosting property for each job posting that you want to advertise. The structured
data should appear on the same page as the job description that job seekers can read in their
browser.
Most properties should only occur once in your job posting web page, unless the description
specifically indicates that it can be added more than once.
If you choose to use sitemaps to keep Google informed of changes to job posting URLs, follow the general sitemap guidelines. In addition, the following sitemap guidelines apply to job
posting URLs.
Make sure Googlebot can access the URLs in the sitemap. Be sure that the URLs you include in the
sitemap are not behind a firewall or disallowed by your robots.txt file.
Use as accurate a time as possible for the <lastmod> (sitemap),
<pubDate> (RSS), or <updated> (Atom) values to indicate
when the page was added or changed. The value should be the last time that the content at the
URL changed. It's important that you use accurate times; crawl bandwidth is limited and accurate
times help us avoid re-crawling pages that haven't changed. In addition, the more Google has to
crawl your pages, the more load will be placed on your servers.
Don't include search results pages, list pages, or other dynamic pages in the sitemap.
The URLs in the sitemap should include
the canonical page
for each job posting.
Job posting content policies
We created the job posting content policies to ensure that our users are connected with jobs
that are open, relevant, and easy to apply to. The
general structured data guidelines and
webmaster
quality guidelines also apply to job postings. If we find content that violates these
policies, we’ll respond appropriately, which may include taking
manual action and removing
the job posting(s) from the job search experience on Google.
Irrelevant content
The JobPosting markup must only be used on pages that contain a single job
posting. We don't allow the use of JobPosting markup in any other page, including
pages that do not list any job.
Incomplete content
We don’t allow job postings with incomplete job descriptions.
Misrepresentation
We don't allow job postings that attempt to impersonate another person or organization, or
otherwise engage in activities intended to deceive, defraud, or mislead others. This includes
falsely implying affiliation with, or endorsement by, another individual or organization. This
also includes using multiple accounts to evade our policies, bypass blocks, or otherwise
subvert restrictions placed on your account.
Policy violation examples include:
Jobs or content that represent the employer in a way that is not accurate, realistic, or
truthful.
Jobs posting for fake or non-existent jobs. This includes job postings with the primary
purpose of collecting information about applicants, rather than seeking to employ these
applicants.
Job titles, description, and other details that use keyword stuffing to manipulate search rankings.
Providing false location data that does not match the actual location of the job.
Job postings on behalf of an organization or company without authorization.
Profanity and vulgar language
We don't allow job postings that contain obscene, profane, or offensive language.
Advertisements disguised as a job posting
We don’t allow promotional content disguised as a job posting, such as those posted by a
third party (for example, affiliate programs).
Legal removal requests
If Google receives a complaint that content in a job posting may violate the law,
the job posting will be handled in accordance with Search policies.
Expired job postings
We don't allow expired job postings. Expired job postings should ideally be
removed from your website. If you prefer to not remove them,
then you need to ensure the validThrough property is populated and in the past. This helps
people review only the job postings that are still hiring.
Jobs without a way to apply
We don't allow job postings that don't have a way to apply. This includes:
Job postings that advertise events such as career fair invitations.
Job postings that require a login to view the job description. Users must be able to see
the job posting details without the need to login.
Resume collection
Publishers may solicit resume collections for open positions only. We may remove solicitations
that collect candidate data, but are not currently hiring.
Job requests
Job postings must describe the open position, include any qualifications needed, and include
other information that would be relevant to a user looking for a job. We don't allow job
postings where the job applicant is offering to perform a job.
Payment required
We don’t allow job postings that require payment from applicants.
Structured data type definitions
This section describes the structured data types related to job postings.
You must include the required properties for your content to be eligible for display in the job
experience on Google Search. You can also include the recommended properties to add more
information about your content, which could provide a better user experience.
JobPosting
The full definition of JobPosting is available at
schema.org/JobPosting.
Required properties
datePosted
Date
The original date that employer posted the job in
ISO 8601 format.
For example, "2017-01-24" or "2017-01-24T19:33:17+00:00".
"datePosted": "2016-02-18"
description
Text
The full description of the job in HTML format.
The description should be a complete representation of the job, including
job responsibilities, qualifications, skills, working hours, education requirements, and
experience requirements. The description can't be the same as the title.
Additional guidelines:
You must format the description in HTML.
At minimum, add paragraph breaks using <br>, <p>,
or \n.
The feature recognizes the following HTML tags: <p>,
<ul>, and <li>.
The feature doesn't recognize header and character-level tags, such as
<h1>, <strong>, and <em>.
While the tags won't affect the formatting in the feature, you can safely include them on
the page.
hiringOrganization
Organization
The organization offering the job position. This should be the name of the company (for
example, "Starbucks, Inc"), and not the specific location that is hiring (for example,
"Starbucks on Main Street"). For example:
"hiringOrganization": {
"@type": "Organization",
"name": "MagsRUs Wheel Company",
"sameAs": "http://www.magsruswheelcompany.com"
}
Logos on third-party job sites
If you have a third-party job site, you can provide a different logo for a given
organization than the image shown in the organization's Knowledge Graph card. To
request a different logo for a hiring organization, add the logo property to the
hiringOrganization array. Make sure that you follow the
logo image guidelines and
Company logo guidelines. For example:
"hiringOrganization": {
"@type": "Organization",
"name": "MagsRUs Wheel Company",
"sameAs": "http://www.magsruswheelcompany.com",
"logo": "http://www.example.com/images/logo.png"
}
jobLocation
Place
The physical location(s) of the business where the employee will report to work (such as
an office or worksite), not the location where the job was posted. Include as many properties
as possible. The more properties you provide, the higher quality the job posting is to our
users. For example:
"jobLocation": {
"@type": "Place",
"address": {
"@type": "PostalAddress",
"streetAddress": "555 Clancy St",
"addressLocality": "Detroit",
"addressRegion": "MI",
"postalCode": "48201",
"addressCountry": "US"
}
}
Multiple physical locations
If the job has multiple locations, add multiple jobLocation properties in an array.
Google will choose the best location to display based on the job seeker's query.
Remote jobs
For jobs in which the employee may or must work remotely 100% of the time, you must use
jobLocationType. The jobLocation
property isn't required if
applicantLocationRequirements
is present.
title
Text
The title of the job (not the title of the posting). For example, "Software Engineer" or
"Barista". For example:
"title": "Software Engineer"
Best practices:
This property should be the title of the job only.
Don't include job codes, addresses, dates, salaries, or company names in the title property.
Not recommended: Apply now for IT job -FRENCH speaker in Bucharest
Recommended: Market Specialist, French speaker
Provide concise, readable titles.
Don't overuse special characters such as "!" and "*". Abusing special characters might
cause your structured data to be considered as
Spammy Structured Markup. Numbers and characters such as "/" and "-" are acceptable.
Not recommended: *** WAREHOUSE HIRING NOW!! ON A BUS ROUTE!! ***
Recommended: Shipping and Receiving Warehouse Associate
Don't use name instead of title. The properties title
and name aren't interchangeable.
If you're a third party job site, don't attempt to modify the job title to follow the
guidelines above, as it can make the title unreadable. Instead, provide the title as you
received it from the employer.
validThrough
DateTime
Note: This is required for job postings that have an expiration date.
The date when the job posting will expire in
ISO 8601 format.
For example, "2017-02-24" or "2017-02-24T19:33:17+00:00".
For example:
"validThrough": "2017-03-18T00:00"
If a job posting never expires, or you do not know when the job will expire, do not
include this property. If the job is filled before the expiration date occurs, remove the
job posting.
Recommended properties
applicantLocationRequirements
AdministrativeArea
The geographic location(s) in which employees may be located for to be eligible for the
Work from home job. The job
description must clearly state that the applicant may be located in certain geographical
location(s). This property is only recommended if applicants may be located in one or more
geographic locations and the job may or must be 100% remote.
The following example suggests a job that can be done remotely anywhere within the United
States:
"applicantLocationRequirements": {
"@type": "Country",
"name": "USA"
},
"jobLocationType": "TELECOMMUTE"
The following example suggests a job can either be done remotely from the country of
Canada or executed at a physical location in Detroit, MI:
"jobLocation": {
"@type": "Place",
"address": {
"@type": "PostalAddress",
"streetAddress": "555 Clancy St",
"addressLocality": "Detroit",
"addressRegion": "MI",
"postalCode": "48201",
"addressCountry": "US"
}
},
"applicantLocationRequirements": {
"@type": "Country",
"name": "Canada"
},
"jobLocationType": "TELECOMMUTE"
baseSalary
MonetaryAmount
The actual base salary for the job, as provided by the employer (not an estimate).
Note: Only employers should provide
baseSalary. If you're a third party job site, you can provide a
salary estimate for an occupation type using the Occupation type.
For the unitText of
QuantitativeValue, use one of the
following case-sensitive values:
"HOUR"
"DAY"
"WEEK"
"MONTH"
"YEAR"
For example:
"baseSalary": {
"@type": "MonetaryAmount",
"currency": "USD",
"value": {
"@type": "QuantitativeValue",
"value": 40.00,
"unitText": "HOUR"
}
}
To specify a salary range, define a minValue and a maxValue, rather
than a single value. For example:
"baseSalary": {
"@type": "MonetaryAmount",
"currency": "USD",
"value": {
"@type": "QuantitativeValue",
"minValue": 40.00,
"maxValue": 50.00,
"unitText": "HOUR"
}
}
employmentType
Text
Type of employment. For example:
"employmentType": "CONTRACTOR"
Choose one or more of the following case-sensitive values:
"FULL_TIME"
"PART_TIME"
"CONTRACTOR"
"TEMPORARY"
"INTERN"
"VOLUNTEER"
"PER_DIEM"
"OTHER"
You can include more than one employmentType property. For example:
"employmentType": ["FULL_TIME", "CONTRACTOR"]
identifier
PropertyValue
The hiring organization's unique identifier for the job.
For example:
"identifier": {
"@type": "PropertyValue",
"name": "MagsRUs Wheel Company",
"value": "1234567"
}
jobLocationType
Text
Set this property with the value TELECOMMUTE for jobs in which the employee may
or must work remotely 100% of the time (from home or another location of their choosing).
In addition to adding jobLocationType, the job description must clearly state
that the job is 100% remote. The jobLocationType property is required if the
job is 100% remote.
Requirements
Jobs marked as TELECOMMUTE must be fully remote. Don't mark up jobs that
allow occasional work-from-home, jobs for which remote work is a negotiable benefit, or
have other arrangements that are not 100% remote. The "gig economy" nature of a job
doesn't imply that it is or is not remote.
You must specify a minimum of one country from which applicants are eligible to work,
using
applicantLocationRequirements
(preferred), or a default to the
country of a jobLocation (provided there is an option to work at a physical
location as well). If a remote job doesn't contain
applicantLocationRequirements, Google shows the job to anyone in the
country specified in jobLocation.
The following example shows that the employee can physically report to work at a job
site located in Tucson, AZ OR can work remotely within the US:
"jobLocation": {
"@type": "Place",
"address": {
"@type": "PostalAddress",
"addressLocality": "Tucson",
"addressRegion": "AZ",
"addressCountry": "US"
}
},
"jobLocationType": "TELECOMMUTE"
Google continues to support TELECOMMUTE as an
additionalProperty of jobLocation. While we don't have immediate
plans to deprecate additionalProperty, we encourage the use of the new schema
where possible.

If you're still experiencing issues, make sure you review our
guidelines.
Important: Google does not guarantee that your structured data
will show up in search results, even if your page is marked up correctly according to the
Rich Results Test. For a list of
common reasons why Google may not show your structured data in search results, see
the General Structured Data Guidelines.
Structured data is on the wrong page
error What caused the issue: A job listing page
(a search results page that contains one or more job postings) has JobPosting
structured data on the page. JobPosting structured data must only be on a
job posting page (a page that contains a single job and isn't a search results page). You
may have received the Search Console message: "Structured data policy violation - A list page
should not include structured data for individual jobs".
done Fix the issue
Remove JobPosting structured data from the listing page. Only place
JobPosting structured data on pages that are dedicated to a single job posting.
After you resolve the issue,
submit your site for
reconsideration.
Content doesn't match the structured data
error What caused the issue: A page includes
content that doesn't match the structured data on the page. For example, the title of a job on
the page doesn't match the value listed for the title property. There may also be
spammy content, like click-baity titles and descriptions, the job seems to be fake, or the
job posting isn't representative of the actual job. For a full
list of examples, see the examples in our content guidelines.
You may have received this Search Console message: "Structured data policy violation -
Content on pages found to be different than structured data on the page".
done Fix the issue
Verify that the structured data aligns with the actual content on the page, is
representative of the job to be performed, and doesn't mislead users.
Use the URL Inspection tool
to make sure that the content is visible on the rendered page (the rendered page is how
Googlebot sees your page).
After you resolve the issue,
submit your site for
reconsideration.
Expired jobs are still live
error What caused the issue: Users can still
access the page through the jobs experience on Google even though the job has expired. Usually,
this is because of the following reasons:
The validThrough property is missing or isn't set to the past.
The page is still live.
The job posting's apply option flow directs to an expired job posting page.
JobPosting structured data is still present on the page even though the job
has expired.
You may have received this Search Console message: "Structured data policy violation -
JobPosting structured data on expired job".
done Fix the issue
Remove the expired job posting by doing one of the following:
Ensure the validThrough property is populated and in the past.
Remove the page entirely (so that requesting it returns a 404 or 410 status code).
Remove JobPosting structured data from the page.
Keep Google informed by using the Indexing API.
If you're not using the Indexing API, submit a new sitemap to Google by sending a
GET request to the following URL:
http://www.google.com/ping?sitemap=location_of_sitemap
For job posting URLs, we recommend using the Indexing API instead of
sitemaps because the Indexing API prompts Googlebot to crawl your page sooner than
removing the URL from the sitemap and pinging Google. However, we still recommend
submitting a sitemap
for coverage of your entire site.
After you resolve the issue,
submit your site for
reconsideration.
Apply option is missing
error What caused the issue: There's no way
for the user to apply for the job on the job posting page. You may have received this Search
Console message: "Structured data policy violation - Can't submit application on job offer page."
done Fix the issue
Make sure there's a way for users to apply for the job on the page.
After you resolve the issue,
submit your site for
reconsideration.
Logo is incorrect
error What caused the issue: Your site doesn't
have a Knowledge Graph or the Knowledge Graph shows an incorrect logo for your site. Google
uses the same logo for your job postings as the image shown in your company’s Knowledge Graph
card. For more information about how Google selects your logo, see
Update your company logo.
done Fix the issue
There are two ways you can fix the issue:
Make sure you specify the correct logo with the
hiringOrganization.logo property. Updating the structured
data is faster than updating the Knowledge Graph and doesn't require you to be verified for
your Knowledge Graph.
Suggest a change to your
Knowledge Graph. Updating your Knowledge Graph provides more control over how your organization
appears on Google, but it may take longer to update. If you need to fix a logo issue quickly,
add the hiringOrganization.logo property.
Job location is missing or incorrect
error What caused the issue: Googlebot doesn't
understand the value(s) provided for the jobLocation, addressLocality,
or addressRegion properties. Google tries to match the location information to a
physical location, and the location provided is either missing or incorrect.
done Fix the issue
Make sure the structured data includes values for jobLocation,
addressLocality, or addressRegion (depending on the location, not
all of the location properties are applicable).
We recommend that you include as many location properties as possible. The
more properties you provide, the higher quality the job posting is to users.
Validate the location fix:
Open the Rich Results Test.
Enter the job posting URL in the Fetch URL box.
Click Validate.
Click Preview.
Success: The Rich Results Test displays the correct
job location in the Google Search Preview Tool.
Try again: The Rich Results Test displays "false"
where the job location should be in the Google Search Preview Tool. Make sure the
location is a real location.
