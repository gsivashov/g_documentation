Movie
Do you want to claim a specific movie in the knowledge panel? Get verified on Google.

Actions.
Mark up your movie lists with structured data so users can explore movies through Google
Search. You can provide details about the movies, such as the title of the movie, director
of the movie, and an image of the movie. The movie carousel is only available on mobile devices.
How to add structured data
Structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page
content. If youâ€™re new to structured data, you can learn more about
how structured data works.
Here's an overview of how to build, test, and release structured data. For a step-by-step guide
on how to add structured data to a web page, check out the
structured
data codelab.
Add the required properties. For information about where to put
structured data on the page, watch JSON-LD structured
data: Where to insert on the page.
Follow the guidelines.
Validate your code using the
Rich Results Test.
Deploy a few pages that include your structured data and use the URL Inspection tool to test how Google sees the page. Be sure that your page is
accessible to Google and not blocked by a robots.txt file, the noindex tag, or
login requirements. If the page looks okay, you can
ask Google to
recrawl your URLs.
Note: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it
may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
To keep Google informed of future changes, we recommend that you
submit a
sitemap. You can automate this with the
Search Console Sitemap
API.
Examples
Summary page + multiple full details pages
The summary page has a short description of each item in the list, and each description points
to a separate details page that is focused entirely on one item. Here's an example of the
summary movie list in JSON-LD:
<html>
<head>
<title>The Best Movies from the Oscars - 2018</title>
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
"@context":"https://schema.org",
"@type":"ItemList",
"itemListElement":[
{
"@type":"ListItem",
"position":1,
"url":"http://example.com/a-star-is-born.html"
},
{
"@type":"ListItem",
"position":2,
"url":"http://example.com/bohemian-rhapsody.html"
},
{
"@type":"ListItem",
"position":3,
"url":"http://example.com/black-panther.html"
}
]
}
</script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
Single, all-in-one-page list
A single, all-in-one-page list hosts all list information, including full text of each item.
Here's an example of a single, all-in-one movie list in JSON-LD:
