Get your event on Google
We added several optional properties: organizer,
eventStatus,
eventAttendanceMode, and
previousStartDate. Due to COVID-19, we
encourage you to add these new properties so people can understand the status of your event
and how they can attend. For more information about this change, check out our
blog post.
The event experience on Google makes it easier for people to discover and attend events
through Google Search results and other Google products, like Google Maps. This feature brings
many benefits:
More interactive results: Your events can be eligible to be displayed in
the event experience on Google, featuring your logo, description of the event, and more.
Increased chances of discovery and conversion: People have a new way to
interact with your event posting and click through to your site. Learn how
Eventbrite saw a 100% increase in
the typical year-over-year growth of traffic from Google Search.
There are three options to make your events eligible to appear on Google:
If you use a third-party website to post events (for example, you post
events on ticketing websites or social platforms), check to see if your event publisher is
already participating in the event search experience on Google. If your event publisher is
integrated with Google, continue to post your events on the third-party website. You can
stop reading here.
If you use a CMS (for example, WordPress) and you don't have access to your HTML, check
with your CMS to see if there's a plugin that can add structured data to your site for you.
Alternatively, you can use the
Data Highlighter to tell
Google about your events without editing the HTML of your site.
If you're comfortable editing your HTML, use
structured data to directly integrate with Google. You’ll need to edit the HTML of the
event pages.
How to add structured data
Structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page
content. If you’re new to structured data, you can learn more about
how structured data works.
Here's an overview of how to build, test, and release structured data. For a step-by-step guide
on how to add structured data to a web page, check out the
structured
data codelab.
Ensure that Googlebot can crawl your event pages (meaning, your pages aren't protected by
a robots.txt file or robots meta tag).
Ensure that your server can handle
increased crawl rate.
Make sure you follow our guidelines.
If you have several copies of the same event posting on your site hosted under different
URLs, use canonical URLs
on each copy of the page.
Add structured data to your event pages. Currently, the event
experience on Google only supports pages that focus on a single event. We recommend
focusing on adding markup to your event posting pages instead of pages that list schedules
or multiple events.
If you’re just getting started, learn more about
how structured data works. You can
also try the
structured
data codelab, which walks you through how to add structured data to your website.
Test and preview your structured data.
Check the index status of your URLs and request for your URL to be
crawled with the
URL inspection tool in
Search Console. To confirm if crawlers are able to access structured data on your page, use
the Live Test feature.
Keep Google informed of new event pages or
changes to existing event pages.
We recommend that you
make your sitemap available
automatically through your server. This is the best way to make sure that your new
and updated content is highlighted to search engines as quickly as possible. Most content
management systems (CMS) can take care of this for you.
Monitor performance in Search
To understand how users interact with your event postings, use the following Google tools:
Use the Performance
Report in Search Console to
showevent listing or
detail view data for a given event posting in Search results. You can automatically
pull these results with the
Search
Console API.
Use the Rich result status
report in Search Console to understand what Google could or could not read from your
site, and troubleshoot rich result errors.
Examples
The actual appearance in search results might be different. Preview the
structured data in the Rich Results Test for the most up-to-date layout.
Standard event
Here's an example of standard Event in JSON-LD. A standard event means that the event
is happening at a physical location only and the event is happened as scheduled. You can also
use Microdata or RDFa syntax.

Guidelines
You must follow these guidelines to be eligible to appear in the event search experience on
Google.
Warning: If your site violates one or more of these guidelines,
then Google may take manual
action against it. Once you have remedied the problem, you can submit your site for reconsideration.

Date and time guidelines
Webmaster guidelines
General structured data guidelines
Technical guidelines
The target page must contain structured data items from event types on schema.org.
Each event MUST have a unique URL (a leaf page) and markup on that URL.
Currently, the event experience on Google only supports pages that focus on a single
event. We recommend focusing on adding markup to your event posting pages instead of pages
that list schedules or multiple events.
Content guidelines
Each event must accurately describe the event name, start date, and location.
Avoid marking non-events as events:
Don’t promote non-event products or services such as "Trip package: San Diego/LA, 7
nights" as events.
Don’t add short-term discounts or purchase opportunities, such as: "Concert — buy your
tickets now," or "Concert - 50% off until Saturday."
Don’t mark business hours as events, such as: "Adventure park open 8 AM to 5PM."
Don't mark coupons or vouchers as events, such as: "5% off your first order."
Mark up multi-day events correctly:
If your event or ticket info is for an event that runs over several days, specify both
the start and end dates of the event.
If there are several different performances across different days, each with individual tickets,
add a separate Event element for each performance.
Date and time guidelines
When implementing the startDate, endDate, and previousStartDate properties, follow these date and time guidelines.
How to specify timezones
Specify the timezone by including the UTC or GMT time offset. If the event starts at
7pm on September 5 in New York, the startDate value would be GMT/UTC-5 during
standard time and GMT/UTC-4 during daylight savings time. During standard time, startDate
value would be "2019-09-05T19:00:00-05:00" or
"2019-09-05T19:00:00-04:00" respectively. If no timezone is provided, Google uses
the timezone of the event's location as specified in location. For online
events, the timezone is required, since there is no location information that Google can use
to understand when the event starts.
Best practices
Event takes place over a range of dates: If the event takes place
over the course of multiple days, indicate both the start and end date. Don't
indicate the time if you don't know the time.
Recommended
"startDate": "2019-07-01T10:00:00-05:00",
"endDate": "2019-07-26T17:00:00-05:00"
Recommended
"startDate": "2019-07-01",
"endDate": "2019-07-26"
Not recommended
"startDate": "2019-07-01T00:00:00+00:00",
"endDate": "2019-07-26T23:59:59+00:00"
Event starts at a specific hour:
If the event starts at a specific time, such as 5pm locally, use
2019-07-20T17:00:00. Include the appropriate UTC offset (for example,
use 2019-07-20T17:00:00-07:00 if the event is in California).
Event is a day long event: If the event is happening all day,
don't specify a granular hour for the start date. For example, you can use
2019-08-15 as both the startDate and endDate
for a day-long event.
Event start hour isn't known: If you don't know the hour for the
start time, don't specify a granular hour. For example, you can use
2019-08-15 as both the startDate and endDate.
Recommended: "startDate": "2025-07-21"
Not recommended: "startDate": "2019-08-15T00:00:00+00:00"
Not recommended: "startDate": "2019-07-20T00:00:00"
Examples of how Google interprets dates
Here are some examples of how Google interprets start date and time:
Structured data
Interpretation
2019-08-15T00:00:00+00:00
Google interprets the startTime to be
2019-08-14T17:00:00-07:00 (if location is set to California) or
2019-08-15T09:00:00 (if location is set to Korea).
2019-08-15T23:59:59+00:00
This doesn't mean the end of 2019-08-15 unless the event happens in
the GMT timezone. Google interprets the startTime to be
2019-08-15T16:59:59-07:00 (if location is set to California) or
2019-08-16T08:59:59 (if location is set to Korea).
2019-07-10
This means the date regardless of the timezone. When used in startDate,
it means the event starts in the location from sometime in that day. When used in
endDate, it means the event ends in the location from sometime in that
day.
2019-07-20T00:00:00
This means midnight on 2019-07-20 for the timezone where the
event happens. This is also likely wrong unless the event was meant to start at
midnight.
Structured data type definitions
The full definition of Event is available
at schema.org/Event.
You must include the required properties for your content to be eligible for display in enhanced search results.
You can also include the recommended properties to add more information about your content,
which could provide a better user experience.
Required properties
location
Place or VirtualLocation
The location of the event. There are different requirements depending on if the event
is happening online or at a physical location:
Physical location: If the event is happening at a physical location, set the @type to Place. Add the location.address and
location.name properties.
Online event: If the event is happening online, set the @type to VirtualLocation. Add the location.url property.
You can start using the VirtualLocation type even though it's still pending on schema.org.
Mix of online and physical locations: If an event has a mix of
online and physical location components, include both online and physical nested location
properties in a nested array. For example:
Show example
"location": [{
"@type": "VirtualLocation",
"url": "https://operaonline.stream5.com/"
},
{
"@type": "Place",
"name": "Snickerpark Stadium",
"address": {
"@type": "PostalAddress",
"streetAddress": "100 West Snickerpark Dr",
"addressLocality": "Snickertown",
"postalCode": "19019",
"addressRegion": "PA",
"addressCountry": "US"
}
}]
Physical locations
If an event is happening at a physical location, nest the following properties for location. For example:
Required properties
location.address
PostalAddress
The venue's detailed street address. This property is only required for events that take
place at a physical location.
Not recommended: Sydney
Recommended: Bennelong Point,
Sydney NSW 2000, Australia
United States example
"location": {
"@type": "Place",
"name": "Snickerpark Stadium",
"address": {
"@type": "PostalAddress",
"streetAddress": "100 West Snickerpark Dr",
"addressLocality": "Snickertown",
"postalCode": "19019",
"addressRegion": "PA",
"addressCountry": "US"
}
}
Japan example
You can write addresses for Japan in different ways, and Google still understands the
address. Here's an example with the street address, locality, and country in
different fields.
"location": {
"@type": "Place",
"name": "ダイバーシティ東京",
"address": {
"@type": "PostalAddress",
"streetAddress": "江東区青海1-10",
"addressLocality": "東京",
"addressCountry": "日本"
}
}
Here's an example of the street address and address country in different fields.
"location": {
"@type": "Place",
"name": "ダイバーシティ東京",
"address": {
"@type": "PostalAddress",
"streetAddress": "東京都江東区青海1-10",
"addressCountry": "日本"
}
}
Here's an example of the entire address on one line.
"location": {
"@type": "Place",
"name": "ダイバーシティ東京",
"address": {
"@type": "PostalAddress",
"name": "東京都江東区青海 1-1-10 ダイバーシティ東京プラザ"
}
}
Best practices for addresses:
If the event happens across several streets, define the starting location and mention
the full details in description.
If the event happens without a well-defined location, use the city name or the most
representative location.
If the event happens at multiple locations at the same time, create different events for
each location.
Recommended properties
location.name
Text
The detailed name of the place or venue where the event is being held. This property
is only recommended for events that take place at a physical location.
DO NOT put the title of the event in this field. Instead, use
name to specify the name of the event.
Not recommended: San Francisco, CA
Recommended: Bill Graham Civic Auditorium
Best practices:
Don't include a city name unless it is a city-wide event.
The location.name property must be the name of the venue or location, not a repeat of
the title of the event. If you don't know the name of the location, don't use this property.
Online events
If an event is happening online, nest the following property in location.
Required properties
location.url
URL
The URL of the online event, where people can join. This property is required if your
event is happening online.
Show example
"location": {
"@type": "VirtualLocation",
"url": "https://operaonline.stream5.com/"
}
name
Text
The full title of the event.
DO NOT put the name of the event location. Instead, use
location.name to specify the name of the location
where the event is being held.
Not recommended: Bill Graham Civic Auditorium
Not recommended: **LIMITED TIME SALE -
Kesha and Macklemore Concert - $25**
Recommended: The Adventures of Kesha and
Macklemore
Recommended: Meet and Greet: Kesha and
Macklemore
Best practices:
Don't use the type of event as the name of the event. For example, "Concert" is not
a descriptive name for an event.
Don't include extraneous information like URLs, prices, or performers. Instead, use
the appropriate properties for those values.
Highlight a unique aspect of the event in the title. This helps users make faster
decisions (for example, "feat. Q&A with the artist").
Don't add short-term promotions (for example, "buy your tickets now").
startDate
DateTime
The start date and start time of the event in
ISO-8601 format.
Add both the date and time so users can more easily find events that fit into their
schedule. For online events, you must specify the timezone by including the UTC or GMT
time offset.
Make sure to follow the Date and time
guidelines.
Show example
"startDate": "2025-07-21T19:00"
Recommended properties
description
Text
Description of the event. Describe all details of the event to make it easier for
users to understand and attend the event.
Best practices:
Add a clear and concise description of the specific event.
Focus on the event details and not your site's features.
Don't repeat other facts like date and location, which should be marked up in the
respective properties.
Show example
"description": "The Adventures of Kira and Morrison is coming to Snickertown in a can’t miss performance."
Google only shows a snippet of the full description.
endDate
DateTime
The end date and end time of the event in
ISO-8601 format.
Use the same format as startDate. Add both the
date and time so users can more easily find events that fit into their schedule. For
online events, you must specify the timezone by including the UTC or GMT time offset.
Make sure to follow the Date and time
guidelines.
Show example
"endDate": "2025-07-21T23:00"
eventAttendanceMode
EventAttendanceModeEnumeration
Indicates whether the event occurs online, offline at a physical location, or a mix of
both online and offline. If you don't include this property, Google understands the
event mode to be
OfflineEventAttendanceMode, which means Google
understands that the event is happening at a physical location. Use one of the
following values:
OfflineEventAttendanceMode
OnlineEventAttendanceMode
MixedEventAttendanceMode
You can start using eventAttendanceMode even though
it's still pending on schema.org.
Online event example
Here's an example of an event that's only happening online:
{
"@context": "https://schema.org",
"@type": "Event",
"eventAttendanceMode": "https://schema.org/OnlineEventAttendanceMode",
"location": {
"@type":"VirtualLocation",
"url": "https://operaonline.stream5.com/"
}
}
Mix of both online and offline example
Here's an example of an event that has parts that are happening online and offline:
{
"@context": "https://schema.org",
"@type": "Event",
"eventAttendanceMode": "https://schema.org/MixedEventAttendanceMode",
"location": {
"@type": "VirtualLocation",
"url": "https://operaonline.stream5.com/"
},
{
"@type": "Place",
"name": "Snickerpark Stadium",
"address": {
"@type": "PostalAddress",
"streetAddress": "100 West Snickerpark Dr",
"addressLocality": "Snickertown",
"postalCode": "19019",
"addressRegion": "PA",
"addressCountry": "US"
}
}
}
eventStatus
EventStatusType
Warning: When the event status changes,
DON'T remove the startDate. The startDate
property is required to help identify the unique event.
The status of the event. If you don't use this field, Google understands the eventStatus to be EventScheduled. Here are the supported values. You can use multiple statuses, if
applicable (for example, if an event was both rescheduled and moved online).
EventCancelled
The event has been canceled.
Don't remove or change other properties (for
example, don't remove startDate or location);
instead, keep all values as the same as they were before the cancelation, and
update the eventStatus to EventCancelled.
Why? Properties like startDate and
location help identify the unique event and
make sure people understand the new status of the event.
Show example
{
"@context": "https://schema.org",
"@type": "Event",
"eventStatus": "https://schema.org/EventCancelled",
"startDate": "2020-07-21T19:00"
}
EventMovedOnline
The event has been moved from in-person attendance to online attendance.
Show example
{
"@context": "https://schema.org",
"@type": "Event",
"eventStatus": "https://schema.org/EventMovedOnline",
"eventAttendanceMode": "https://schema.org/OnlineEventAttendanceMode",
"location": {
"@type":"VirtualLocation",
"url": "https://operaonline.stream5.com/"
},
"startDate": "2020-07-21T19:00"
}
EventPostponed
The event has been postponed to a later date, but the date isn't known yet. Keep the original date in the startDate of the event until you know when the event will take place. Once you know the new date information, change the eventStatus to EventRescheduled and update the startDate and endDate with the new date information.
Don't remove or change other properties (for
example, don't remove the startDate or location);
instead, keep all values as the same as they were before the postponement, and
update the eventStatus to EventPostponed.
Why? Properties like startDate and
location help identify the unique event and
make sure people understand the new status of the event.
Show example
{
"@context": "https://schema.org",
"@type": "Event",
"eventStatus": "https://schema.org/EventPostponed",
"startDate": "2020-07-21T19:00"
}
EventRescheduled
The event has been rescheduled to a later date. Update the
startDate and endDate
with the relevant new dates. Optionally, you can also mark the eventStatus
field as rescheduled and add the previousStartDate.
Show example
{
"@context": "https://schema.org",
"@type": "Event",
"eventStatus": "https://schema.org/EventRescheduled",
"startDate": "2020-07-21T19:00",
"endDate": "2025-07-21T23:00",
"previousStartDate": "2025-03-21T19:00"
}
EventScheduled
The event is scheduled to happen. This value is the default status for events. If you
don't set eventStatus, Google understands the event to be happening on schedule.
Show example
{
"@context": "https://schema.org",
"@type": "Event",
"eventStatus": "https://schema.org/EventScheduled",
"startDate": "2020-07-21T19:00"
}
image
Repeated ImageObject or
URL
URL of an image or logo for the event or tour. Including an image helps users
understand and engage with your event. We recommend that images are 1920px wide
(the minimum width is 720px).
Additional image guidelines:
Every page must contain at least one image (whether or not you include markup). Google will pick
the best image to display in Search results based on the aspect ratio and resolution.
Image URLs must be crawlable and indexable.
Images must represent the marked up content.
Images must be in .jpg, .png, or. gif format.
For best results, provide multiple high-resolution images (minimum of 50K pixels when multiplying width and
height) with the following aspect ratios: 16x9, 4x3, and 1x1.
For example:
"image": [
"https://example.com/photos/1x1/photo.jpg",
"https://example.com/photos/4x3/photo.jpg",
"https://example.com/photos/16x9/photo.jpg"

}
This URL must meet the following requirements:
Direct to a landing page that clearly and predominantly provides the opportunity to buy
a ticket offering admittance to that specific event to any user from the general
public.
Be a link that a user could click on the web page that contains the event.
Be followable by the Googlebot (not blocked by robots.txt).

Event location is missing or incorrect
error What caused the issue: Googlebot doesn't understand the values provided for the eventLocation, addressLocality, or addressRegion properties.
Google tries to match the location information to a physical location, and the location
provided is either missing or incorrect.
done Fix the issue
Make sure the structured data includes values for eventLocation,
addressLocality, or addressRegion (depending on the location,
since not all of the location properties are applicable).
Check that the location.name field uses the location name, or leave it blank
if it does not have a name. A common issue is accidentally placing the event name in the
location.name field.
Validate the fix:
Open the Rich Results Test.
Enter the event posting URL in the Fetch URL box.
Click Validate.
Click Preview.
Success: The Rich Results Test displays the correct
eventLocation in the Google Search Preview Tool.
Try again: The Rich Results Test displays "false" where the event
location should be in the Google Search Preview Tool. Make sure the location is a real
location.
My site isn't showing up as an option for
purchasing tickets
error What caused the issue: The
offers.url property is missing or doesn't meet the
URL requirements.
done Fix the issue
Make sure that your structured data includes the
offers.url property.
Ensure that your URL meets the URL requirements for
offers.url.
Ask Google to recrawl your
site.
Submit a request for (re)evaluation.
Time or date is incorrect
error What caused the issue: The time or date is incorrect. Common errors include
not offsetting for the time zone or specifying an incorrect start time (for example, midnight
as a start time).
done Fix the issue
Specify the correct local time offset. For example, if your event starts
at 7pm in New York (UTC - 5) and ends at 9pm, then the value for startDate is
2019-08-15T19:00:00-05:00 and the value for endDate is
2019-08-15T21:00:00-05:00. If you are unable to fill in the offset for your
events, don't offset the time (for example, use 2019-08-15T19:00:00).
Make sure the start or end time is accurate. One common mistake is
setting an event to start at midnight when the event doesn't actually start at midnight. If
the event is a day long event, or the start hour hasn't been announced, only specify the
day. For example:
