Automated queries
Google's Terms of Service do not allow the sending of
automated
queries of any sort to our system without express permission in advance from Google.
Sending automated queries consumes resources and includes using any software (such as
WebPosition Gold) to send automated queries to Google to determine how a website or web page
ranks in Google search results for various queries. In addition to rank checking, other types
of automated access to Google without permission are also a violation of our
Webmaster Guidelines and
Terms of Service.
