About Monster India
Monster.com is a global online employment solution for people seeking jobs and the employers who
need great people. They have expanded from being a job board to being a global provider of a full
array of job seeking, career management, recruitment, and talent management products and
services. Monster India started its operations in 2001 and has presence in 11 cities of India.
Jobs on Google Search
Monster India’s search engine optimization (SEO) team began
using structured data in April 2018 with
the goal to improve their applicant and resume database. The team launched
Job Posting structured data
with a pilot that was later scaled to markup all their jobs in India after realizing initial
positive performance in Jobs on Google Search.
Results
Jobs on Google Search provided huge incremental traffic, detail views, and applications over what
Monster.com was previously able to achieve with SEO efforts as well as paid campaigns.
Monster.com is set to launch in South East Asia as soon as Jobs on Google Search is live in these
markets.
"Jobs on Google Search is a great way for job seekers to find relevant content in an easy-to-use
format. We tested it first for Monster India and saw an increase in organic traffic as well as
job applications. Based on this experience, the integration was implemented for Monster Gulf,
Monster Philippines, Monster Singapore, Monster Malaysia, and the results are great across all
regions. The organic traffic to website has almost doubled since we have launched this across
countries."
— Anshul Punhani, Chief Marketing Officer, (APAC and Gulf regions), Monster.com
