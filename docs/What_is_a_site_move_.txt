What is a site move?
As a site owner, it is possible that at some point you'll want to move your site to a different
URL or different infrastructure. This page covers the different scenarios of site moves and
gives you tips about how to prepare, implement, and monitor the move.
In this documentation, a site redesign is not considered a site move,
even if it involves adding extra URLs. A redesign is changing the layout of existing
pages, or adding pages of new content. A move is moving existing pages in one of the following
ways:
Site move
without URL changes
The underlying infrastructure serving the website is changed, but there are no visible changes
to the URL. For example, if you move www.example.com to a different hosting provider
while keeping www.example.com as the same root URL for your site.
Site move
with URL changes
The page URLs change. For example:
Protocol changes — http://www.example.com to
https://www.example.com
Domain name changes — example.com to
example.net
URL path changes — example.com/page.php?id=1 to
example.com/widget
To change how your site serves mobile versus desktop users, see the
mobile-friendly site design guide.
Recommendations for all site moves
Split your move into smaller steps, if that makes sense for your site.
We recommend initially moving just a piece of the site to test any effects on traffic and
search indexing. After that you can move the rest of your site all at once or in chunks.
When choosing the initial test section of the site, pick a section that changes less
frequently and isn't significantly affected by frequent or unpredictable events. Also keep
in mind that while moving just one section is a great way to test your move, it's not
necessarily representative of a whole site move when it comes to search. The more pages
that you move, the more likely you'll encounter additional problems to solve. Careful
planning can minimize problems.
Time your move to coincide with lower traffic, if possible.
If your traffic is seasonal or dips on certain weekdays, it makes sense to move your site
during the recurring traffic dips. This lowers the impact of anything that breaks, and also dedicates
more of your server's power to helping Googlebot update our index.
Expect temporary fluctuation in site ranking during the move.
With any significant change to a site, you may experience ranking fluctuations while
Google recrawls and reindexes your site. As a general rule, a medium-sized website can
take a few weeks for most pages to move in our index; larger sites can take longer. The
speed at which Googlebot and our systems discover and process moved URLs largely depends on
the number of URLs and your server speed. Submitting a sitemap can help make the discovery
process quicker, and it's fine to move your site in sections.
