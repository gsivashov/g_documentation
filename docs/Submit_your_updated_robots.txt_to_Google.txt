Submit your updated robots.txt to Google
The Submit function of the
robots.txt Tester
tool allows you to easily update and ask Google to more quickly crawl and use a new robots.txt
file for your site. Update and notify Google of changes to your robots.txt file by following the
steps below.
Click Submit in the bottom-right corner of the robots.txt editor. This action
opens up a Submit dialog.
Download your edited robots.txt code from the robots.txt Tester page by
clicking Download in the Submit dialog.
Upload your new robots.txt file to the root of your domain as a text file named robots.txt
(the URL for your robots.txt file should be /robots.txt).
If you do not have permission to upload files to the root of your domain, you should
contact your domain manager to make changes.
For example, if your site home page resides under
subdomain.example.com/site/example/, you likely cannot update
the robots.txt file at subdomain.example.com/robots.txt. In
this case, you should contact the owner of example.com/ to
make any necessary changes to the robots.txt file.
Click View uploaded version to see that your live robots.txt is the version
that you want Google to crawl.
Click Submit to notify Google that changes have been made to your
robots.txt file and request that Google crawl it.
Check that your newest version was successfully crawled by Google by refreshing the page in
your browser to update the tool's editor and see your live robots.txt code. After you refresh
the page, you can also click the dropdown above the text editor to view the timestamp of when
Google first saw the latest version of your robots.txt file.
