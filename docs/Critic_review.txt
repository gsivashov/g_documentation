Critic review
Does your site provide combined rating scores from reviewers?
Use review snippet structured data.
Does your site provide reviews about other employers? Use
Employer Aggregate Rating structured
data.
Does your site review claims made by others? Use
Fact check structured data.
A critic review is a snippet from a longer review article that a single editor has created,
curated, or compiled for a publisher. Critic reviews appear in Search results with a snippet
from the critic, the critic's name and the publisher icon, helping your readers to easily
find the reviews and navigate to your website to read the complete reviews. You can supply
critic reviews for the following content types:
Local businesses
Movies
Books
Currently, Google is working with a limited number of providers at a time to
integrate each provider into the feature. You're welcome to read the documentation and
implement structured data until we can open it up to more providers. Keep in mind that
Google doesn't guarantee that your structured data will show up in search results, even if
your page is marked up correctly according to the Rich Results Test.
How to add structured data
Structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page
content. If you're new to structured data, you can learn more about
how structured data works.
Here's an overview of how to build, test, and release structured data. For a step-by-step guide
on how to add structured data to a web page, check out the
structured
data codelab.
Add the required properties. For information about where to put
structured data on the page, watch JSON-LD structured
data: Where to insert on the page.
Follow the guidelines.
Validate your code using the
Rich Results Test.
Deploy a few pages that include your structured data and use the URL Inspection tool to test how Google sees the page. Be sure that your page is
accessible to Google and not blocked by a robots.txt file, the noindex tag, or
login requirements. If the page looks okay, you can
ask Google to
recrawl your URLs.
Note: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it
may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
To keep Google informed of future changes, we recommend that you
submit a
sitemap. You can automate this with the
Search Console Sitemap
API.
Examples
You can embed critic reviews inside LocalBusiness. This is useful for sites that
provide booking services for many businesses or for business listing aggregators. Here's an
example of an embedded review of a business in JSON-LD:

Guidelines
Your content must follow these guidelines to be eligible to appear as a rich result.
Warning: If your site violates one or more of these guidelines,
then Google may take manual
action against it. Once you have remedied the problem, you can submit your site for
reconsideration.
Technical guidelines
Content guidelines
Webmaster guidelines
General structured data guidelines
Technical guidelines
Refer clearly to a specific product or service by nesting the review within the markup of
another schema.org type, such as schema.org/Book or
schema.org/LocalBusiness, or by using a
schema.org type as a value for the itemReviewed property.
Make sure the reviews and ratings you mark up are readily available to users from the
marked-up page. It should be immediately obvious to users that the page has review
content.
Provide review information about a specific item, not about a category or a list of
items.
Recommended: Hesperia Madrid Hotel
Not recommended: Top 10 hotels in Madrid
Content guidelines
Authoritative human editor(s) must create, curate, or compile content for critic
reviews.
The snippet can't exceed 200 characters.
The snippet must clearly indicate an opinion about the review subject. It should not
merely define the subject (for example, ""Gravity" is a film by Alfonso Cuar√≥n") or a plot
synopsis (for example, "Dr. Ryan Stone is an engineer on her first space mission").
Critic reviews can't be template sentences built from data or automated metrics.
Don't include critic reviews that are duplicated or similar across many
businesses.
Only include critic reviews that have been directly produced by your site, not reviews
from third-party sites or syndicated reviews.
Use non-smart double quotation marks (") to denote titles (for example, ""Gravity" is the
best movie.")
The snippet must make sense on its own and should not be confusing to someone who isn't
reading the whole article.
The snippet must be an exact excerpt from the long-form body of the review. It should
not be the review headline, a question or a teaser.
The snippet must be complete (not cut off, truncated, or ending in ellipses) and
well-formed (having correct punctuation and grammar) thought.
Avoid profanity and vulgar language. Reviews should be appropriate for a broad and diverse
audience. Consequently, reviews containing vulgar or profane language may be ineligible for
use.
Don't add critic review structured data for adult-related products or services.
If the critic review is for a local business, you must follow these additional guidelines:
Snippets must not be written by the business or content provider, and may not be
provided by the business or content provider unless
they are genuine, independent, and unpaid editorial reviews.
Critic reviews must allow for customers to express both positive and negative
sentiments. They may not be vetted by the business or restricted by the content provider
based on the positive or negative sentiment of the review before submission to
Google.
Critic reviews for multiple-location businesses such as retail chains or franchises can
only be submitted for the specific business location for which they were written. In
other words, critic reviews for multiple-location businesses can't be syndicated or
applied to all business locations of the same company.
There can't be any commercial agreements (paid or otherwise) to provide critic reviews
between the content provider and the reviewed business.
Structured data type definitions
You must include the following required
properties for your content to be eligible for display as a rich result. You can also include

reviewRating
Must be one of the following:
Rating
The rating given in this review on a scale (for example, 3 out of 5 stars).
Ratings can be either numeric (for example, 1-5) or text (for example, A-F), where
you define the best and worst score in the bestRating and
worstRating properties. The rating
can be a nested Rating or more specific
subtype. The most typical subtype is
AggregateRating. Here's an
example of reviewRating.Rating:
"reviewRating": [{
"@type": "Rating",
"ratingValue": "3.0",
"bestRating": "5",
"worstRating": "0"
}]
EndorsementRating
A rating that expresses some level of positive endorsement for the item being
reviewed. For example, inclusion in a "critic's pick" blog, a "Like", or "+1" on a
social network. EndorsementRating is a rating by itself (for example,
"2 thumbs up"), not a rating on a scale. Here's an example of
reviewRating.EndorsementRating:
"reviewRating": [{
"@type": "EndorsementRating",
"name": "2 thumbs up",
"ratingValue": "2"
}]
Additional guidelines:
Google recommends using a text string up to a few words in length
(approximately 10-15 characters).
An EndorsementRating may be part of a numeric scale or organized
system.
If the scale is not numeric, indicate that the endorsement is positive to help
consumers understand that the rating is broadly positive.
reviewRating.bestRating
Text
The highest value allowed in this rating system. This property is required if the
rating system is not on a 5-point scale. If bestRating is omitted, 5 is
assumed.
reviewRating.ratingValue
Text
The rating given to the reviewed item. Letter grades are allowed. For example,
"B+".
reviewRating.worstRating
Text
The lowest value allowed in this rating system. The worstRating property
is required if the rating system is not on a 5-point scale. If worstRating
is omitted, 1 is assumed.
URL
URL
URL of the web page that contains the full text of the review.
The webpage indicated by this property must contain a full-length review that is longer
than 300 words.
Other use cases:
If no value is provided, Google assumes that the crawled page is the
location of the review in its entirety.
If your structured data is on a page other than the one containing the full text of
the review, or if you have multiple URLs for the full-text review, you must populate
this property.
If you have duplicate pages for the same content, make sure you use the
canonical URL.
Monitor rich results with Search Console
Search Console is a tool that helps you monitor how your pages perform in Google Search.
You don't have to sign up for Search Console to be included in Google Search results,
but it can help you understand and improve how Google sees your site. We
recommend checking Search Console in the following cases:
After deploying structured data for the first time
After releasing new templates or updating your code
Analyzing traffic periodically
After deploying structured data for the first time
After Google has indexed your pages, look for issues using the relevant
Rich result status report.
Ideally you should see an increase of valid pages, and no increase in errors or warnings. If you find issues
in your structured data:
Fix the errors.
Inspect a live URL to check if the issue persists.
Request validation using the status report.
After releasing new templates or updating your code
When you make significant changes to your website, monitor for increases in structured data errors and warnings.
If you see an increase in errors, perhaps you rolled out a new template that doesn't work, or your site interacts with the existing
template in a new and bad way.
If you see a decrease in valid items (not matched by an increase in errors), perhaps you are
no longer embedding structured data in your pages. Use the
URL Inspection tool to learn what is causing the issue.
Analyzing traffic periodically
Analyze your Google Search traffic using the Performance Report.
The data will show you how often your page appears as a rich result in Search, how often users click on it and what is
the average position you appear on search results. You can also automatically pull these
results with the Search
Console API.
Troubleshooting
Important: Google does not guarantee that features that consume structured data will
show up in search results. For a list of common reasons why Google may not
show your content in a rich result, see the General
Structured Data Guidelines.
If you're having trouble implementing structured data, here are some resources that may help you.
You might have an error in your structured data. Check the
list of structured
data errors.
Troubleshoot
missing rich results / drop in total rich results.
For general questions about crawling and indexing, check the
Google Search crawling and indexing FAQ.
Note: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it
may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
Ask a question in the Google Search Central office hours.
Post a question in the Google Search Central
