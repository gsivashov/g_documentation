Request a review
You must request a review from Google to have your page or site unflagged as
dangerous or possibly deceptive to users.
You'll need
Knowledge of shell/terminal commands
What you'll do
1. Prerequisites
Before requesting a review, confirm that you've taken the following steps:
Verified ownership of your site in Search Console
Cleaned your site of the hacker's vandalism
Corrected the vulnerability
Brought your clean site back online
2. Double-check that your pages are available and clean
To be safe, use either Wget or cURL to view pages on your site, such as your
homepage and a URL modified by the hacker; these should now be clean. If so,
and you're confident that same applies to the rest of the pages on your site,
it's time to request a review.
Note: Your pages must be available to be crawled by Googlebot to ensure that
they are clean. Make sure that they are not roboted out or blocked from
indexing by noindex robots META tags or directives.
3. Request a review
Before requesting a review:
be sure that the problem is truly fixed;
requesting a review if the problem still exists will only prolong the period
of time that your site is flagged as dangerous.
double-check where you should request a review; the review process will
take place in a specific tool, depending on the issue your site is facing.
Please refer to the channels below.
A. Hacked site
You received a hacked site notification in the
Security Issues report
of the Search Console:
Now that you have gone through the successive steps of the clean-up process,
you can go in the Security Issues report
report again and find the issue either as a site-wide match, or as a partial
match.
Select Request a review.
In order to submit a review, we ask that you provide more information on what
you did to clean the site. For each category of hacked spam, you can write a
sentence explaining how the site was cleaned (for example, "For Content
injection hacked URLs, I removed the spammy content and corrected the
vulnerability: updating an out-of-date plugin.").
B. Unwanted software (including malware)
You received a malware or unwanted software notification in the
Security Issues report
of the Search Console:
Open the
Security Issues report
again in Search Console. The report may still show the warnings and sample
infected URLs you saw before.
Select Request a review.
In order to submit a review, we ask that you provide more information on
what you did to remove the policy violation from your site. For example,
"I removed the 3rd-party code that was distributing malware on my
website and replaced it with a more modern version of the code".
You did not receive a malware or unwanted software notification in the
Security Issues report
of the Search Console, but you received a notification in your AdWords account:
Request a review through the
AdWords support center.
C. Phishing or Social Engineering
You received a phishing notification in the
Security Issues report
of the Search Console:
Open the
Security Issues report
again in Search Console. The report may still show the warnings and sample
infected URLs you saw before.
Select Request a review.
In order to submit a review, we ask you to provide more information on
what you did to remove the policy violation from your site. For example,
"I removed the page that was asking users to enter personal information".
You can also request the review at
google.com/safebrowsing/report_error/.
On top of serving as a reporting tool for site owners who believe their page
was incorrectly flagged for phishing, this report will trigger a review of
phishing pages that have been cleaned to lift warnings.
4. Wait for the review to be processed
Hacked with spam review process time: Reviews for sites hacked with
spam may require up to several weeks to process. This is because spam
reviews can involve manual investigation or a complete reprocessing of
the hacked pages. If the review is approved, Security Issues will no
longer display hacked category types or example hacked URLs.
Malware review processing time: Reviews for sites infected with
malware require a few days to process. Once the review is completed, the
response will be available within your Messages in Search Console.
Phishing review processing time: Phishing reviews take about a day to
process. If successful, the user-visible phishing warning will be
removed and your page may again surface in search results.
If Google finds that your site is clean, warnings from browsers and
search results should be removed within 72 hours.
If Google determines that you have not fixed the problem, the Security
Issues report in Search Console could display more sample infected
URLs to assist your next investigation for example. Malware, phishing or hacked
with spam site warnings will remain in search results and/or browsers as a
caution to protect users.
Final steps
If your request was approved, verify that your site works as expected:
pages load properly and links are clickable. To keep your site safe,
we encourage all site owners to implement the maintenance and security
plan created in Clean and maintain your site.

If your request wasn't approved, reassess your site for
malware or spam, or for any
modifications or new files created by the hacker. Alternatively, you
can consider requesting more help from
specialists in your support team.
