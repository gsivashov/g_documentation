Verifying Googlebot
You can verify if a web crawler accessing your server really is Googlebot (or another
Google user agent). This
is useful if you're concerned that spammers or other troublemakers are accessing your site
while claiming to be Googlebot. Google doesn't post a public list of IP addresses for website
owners to allowlist. This is because these IP address ranges can change, causing problems for
any website owners who have hard-coded them, so you must run a DNS lookup as described next.
To verify that Googlebot is the crawler:
Run a reverse DNS lookup on the accessing IP address from your logs, using the
host command.
Verify that the domain name is either googlebot.com or
google.com.
Run a forward DNS lookup on the domain name retrieved in step 1 using the
host command on the retrieved domain name. Verify that it's the same as the
original accessing IP address from your logs.
Example 1:
> host 66.249.66.1
1.66.249.66.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer crawl-66-249-66-1.googlebot.com.
> host crawl-66-249-66-1.googlebot.com
crawl-66-249-66-1.googlebot.com has address 66.249.66.1
Example 2:
> host 66.249.90.77
77.90.249.66.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer rate-limited-proxy-66-249-90-77.google.com.
> host rate-limited-proxy-66-249-90-77.google.com
rate-limited-proxy-66-249-90-77.google.com has address 66.249.90.77
