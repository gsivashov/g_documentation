Challenge
StyleCraze is an online magazine that focuses on the latest updates, tips, and resources in
beauty, health and wellness, and all topics that matter the most to the woman of today. The
biggest challenge for StyleCraze was a lack of an image-driven experience that could aid
discovery of content. StyleCraze has a library of how-to content, and they were looking for a
way to reach their users effectively.
Solution
StyleCraze wanted to provide their users with richer previews of step-by-step tasks. To be
eligible for the How-to rich result feature, they decided to test HowTo
structured data on the relevant articles on their site by following the
How-to developer documentation.
They selected one article and applied markup along with images and text. They also tested
the implementation with the Structured
Data Testing Tool. Once the page was indexed, they were able to see the mobile version
immediately. Here are some examples of the How-to rich results they saw in Google Search.
Results
StyleCraze saw their click-through-rate (CTR) increase by 20% (from 4.4% to 5.3%) for the
first URL. They implemented How-to structured data to five other how-to articles to
understand how this could work for them at scale. After a pre-post analysis, they noticed
that all articles with structured data showed positive results. As a result, they swiftly
expanded markup implementation to
regional language articles as well. "We saw tremendous
impact in CTRs from using How-to Structured data on our website", says Abhishek Jha, VP
Marketing at StyleCraze.
Whatâ€™s next for StyleCraze? They plan to implement Howto structured data to all
how-to articles on their site.
