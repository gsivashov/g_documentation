Scraped content
Some website owners use content taken ("scraped") from other, more reputable sites on the
assumption that increasing the volume of pages on their site is a good long-term strategy
regardless of the relevance or uniqueness of that content. Purely scraped content, even from
high-quality sources, may not provide any added value to your users without additional useful
services or content provided by your site; it may also constitute copyright infringement in
some cases. It's worthwhile to take the time to create original content that sets your site
apart. This will keep your visitors coming back and will provide more useful results for users
searching on Google.
Some examples of scraping include:
Sites that copy and republish content from other sites without adding any original content
or value
Sites that copy content from other sites, modify it slightly (for example, by substituting
synonyms or using automated
techniques), and republish it
Sites that reproduce content feeds from other sites without providing some type of unique
organization or benefit to the user
Sites dedicated to embedding content such as video, images, or other media from other
sites without substantial added value to the user
