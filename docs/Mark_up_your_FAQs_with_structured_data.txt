Mark up your FAQs with structured data
Does your site allow users to submit answers to a single
question? Use QAPage structured
data instead.
A Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) page contains a list of questions and answers pertaining to a
particular topic. Properly marked up FAQ pages may be eligible to have a rich result on
Search and an Action on the Google Assistant, which can
help your site reach the right users. Here's an example of an FAQ rich result:
How to add structured data
Structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page
content. If you're new to structured data, you can learn more about
how structured data works.
Here's an overview of how to build, test, and release structured data. For a step-by-step guide
on how to add structured data to a web page, check out the
structured
data codelab.
Add the required properties. For information about where to put
structured data on the page, watch JSON-LD structured
data: Where to insert on the page.
Follow the guidelines.
Validate your code using the
Rich Results Test.
Deploy a few pages that include your structured data and use the URL Inspection tool to test how Google sees the page. Be sure that your page is
accessible to Google and not blocked by a robots.txt file, the noindex tag, or
login requirements. If the page looks okay, you can
ask Google to
recrawl your URLs.
Note: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it
may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
To keep Google informed of future changes, we recommend that you
submit a
sitemap. You can automate this with the
Search Console Sitemap
API.
Feature availability
FAQ rich results are available in all countries and languages where Google Search
is available. The feature is available on desktop and mobile devices.

Guidelines
For your FAQ page to be eligible for FAQ rich results, you must follow these guidelines:
General structured data guidelines
Webmaster guidelines
Content guidelines
Content guidelines
Only use FAQPage if your page has a list of questions with answers. If your page
has a single question and users can submit alternative answers, use
QAPage instead. Here are some examples:
Valid use cases:
An FAQ page written by the site itself, with no way for users to submit alternative answers
A product support page that lists FAQs, with no way for users to submit alternative answers
Invalid use cases:
A forum page where users can submit answers to a single question
A product support page where users can submit answers to a single question
A product page where users can submit multiple questions and answers on a single page
Don't use FAQPage for advertising purposes.
Make sure each Question includes the entire text of the question and
make sure each Answer includes the entire text of the answer. The entire
question text and answer text may be displayed.
Question and answer content may not be displayed as a rich result if it contains any of the
following types of content: obscene, profane, sexually explicit, graphically violent,
promotion of dangerous or illegal activities, or hateful or harassing language.
All FAQ content must be visible to the user on the source page.
If you have FAQ content that is repetitive on your site (meaning, the same question and answer appear on multiple pages
on your site), mark up only one instance of that FAQ for your entire site.
Structured data type definitions
You must include the required properties for your content to be eligible for display as a rich
result. You can also include the recommended properties to add more information to your structured
data, which could provide a better user experience.
FAQPage
The full definition of FAQPage is
provided on schema.org.
The FAQPage type indicates that the page is an FAQ with answered questions. There
must be one FAQPage type definition per page.
Required properties
mainEntity
Question
An array of Question elements which comprise the list of answered questions
that this FAQPage is about.
Question
The full definition of Question is
provided on schema.org.
The Question type defines a single answered question within the FAQ. Every
Question instance must be contained within the mainEntity property array
of the schema.org/FAQPage.
Required properties
acceptedAnswer
Answer
The answer to the question. There must be one answer per question.
name
Text
The full text of the question. For example, "How long does it take to process a refund?".
Answer

provided on schema.org.
The Answer type defines the acceptedAnswer to each of the
Question on this page.
Required properties

<div>, <b>,
<strong>, <i>,
and <em>.
Monitor rich results with Search Console
Search Console is a tool that helps you monitor how your pages perform in Google Search.
You don't have to sign up for Search Console to be included in Google Search results,
but it can help you understand and improve how Google sees your site. We
recommend checking Search Console in the following cases:
After deploying structured data for the first time
After releasing new templates or updating your code
Analyzing traffic periodically
After deploying structured data for the first time
After Google has indexed your pages, look for issues using the relevant
Rich result status report.
Ideally you should see an increase of valid pages, and no increase in errors or warnings. If you find issues
in your structured data:
Fix the errors.
Inspect a live URL to check if the issue persists.
Request validation using the status report.
After releasing new templates or updating your code
When you make significant changes to your website, monitor for increases in structured data errors and warnings.
If you see an increase in errors, perhaps you rolled out a new template that doesn't work, or your site interacts with the existing
template in a new and bad way.
If you see a decrease in valid items (not matched by an increase in errors), perhaps you are
no longer embedding structured data in your pages. Use the
URL Inspection tool to learn what is causing the issue.
Analyzing traffic periodically
Analyze your Google Search traffic using the Performance Report.
The data will show you how often your page appears as a rich result in Search, how often users click on it and what is
the average position you appear on search results. You can also automatically pull these
results with the Search
Console API.
Troubleshooting
Important: Google does not guarantee that features that consume structured data will
show up in search results. For a list of common reasons why Google may not
show your content in a rich result, see the General
Structured Data Guidelines.
If you're having trouble implementing structured data, here are some resources that may help you.
You might have an error in your structured data. Check the
list of structured
data errors.
Troubleshoot
missing rich results / drop in total rich results.
For general questions about crawling and indexing, check the
Google Search crawling and indexing FAQ.
Note: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it
may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
Ask a question in the Google Search Central office hours.
Post a question in the Google Search Central
forum.
