Establish your business details with Google
You can enhance the appearance and coverage of your official website and presence in Search
results by first establishing it with Google. This makes it easier for users to recognize your
official site and reach information you provide more easily when they search.
Google offers a variety of ways to help you provide
key business details so that they show up for users in Search results. This guide
describes how to make your businesses location, official site, and content info
available for results, Google knowledge panel, and Google Maps.
Claim your local business
To claim an existing physical business or create a new one, use Google My Business.
Once you verify yourself as the owner
of a listing, you can provide or edit your address, contact info, business type, and photos.
This enables your local business information to show up in Google Maps and Google knowledge panel.
Register your website with Search Console
The first step in establishing your website as an official presence is to
verify website ownership in Search Console. This
process verifies the owners and operators of the site. Once you've verified your website,
you can use Search Console to understand and monitor how Google displays information about your
site.
Update your site’s Google knowledge panel
Google algorithms find information, like your site's name, corporate contact
information, and social profiles, that is publicly available on the web. You can update
or provide more information for your site for broader reach and recognition in Search
results. If you’re verified as an official representative, you can
update
your Google knowledge panel to override the information Google finds automatically.
Add structured data
Google Search works hard to understand the content of a page. You can help us by providing
explicit clues about the meaning of a page to Google by including structured data on the page.
Structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying
the page content. Learn more about structured
data.
Here are some structured data features that all websites can benefit from:
Site logo: You can specify which image Google should use as your organization's logo in
Search results and your Google knowledge panel. To do this, add
Logo structured data to your official website that
identifies the location of your preferred logo.
Breadcrumbs: Breadcrumb trails on a page indicate the page's position in
the site hierarchy. A user can navigate all the way up in the site hierarchy, one level at a
time, by starting from the last breadcrumb in the breadcrumb trail. To help Google understand
your breadcrumbs, you can add Breadcrumb
structured data to your site.
Troubleshooting
If you're experiencing issues with your site's information, try the following troubleshooting
tips:
Make suggested changes to your Google knowledge panel.
If you have waited at least one
week since your marked-up page was last crawled by Google, report information
that you believe is incorrect in a Google knowledge panel, by
clicking the Feedback link at the bottom of the Google knowledge panel.
If you are a recognized authority or the site or entity represented in the Google knowledge panel,
you can view more options for providing specific edits.
