Ask Google to recrawl your URLs
If you've recently added or made changes to a page on your site, you can request that Google re-index your page using any of the methods listed here.
General guidelines
Crawling can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. Be patient and monitor progress using either the Index Status report or the URL Inspection tool.
All methods described here have about the same response time.
There is a quota for submitting individual URLs.
Requesting a recrawl multiple times for the same URL or sitemap won't get it crawled any faster.
Crawl request methods
Use the URL Inspection tool (just a few URLs)
Use the URL Inspection tool to request a crawl of individual URLs. Note that if you have large numbers of URLs, you should submit a sitemap instead.
To submit a URL to the index:
Read the general guidelines above.
Inspect the URL using the URL Inspection tool.
Select Request indexing. The tool will run a live test on the URL to see whether it has any obvious indexing issues, and if not, the page will be queued for indexing. If the tool finds issues with the page you should try to fix them.
Note: Requesting a crawl does not guarantee that inclusion will happen instantly or even at all. Our systems prioritize the fast inclusion of high quality, useful content.
Submit a sitemap (many URLs at once)
A sitemap is an important way for Google to discover URLs on your site. A sitemap can also include additional metadata about alternate language versions and video-, image-, or news-specific pages. Learn how to create a sitemap.
If you have not changed your sitemap since the last time Google crawled it, resubmitting the sitemap won't have any additional benefit. If you have updated pages in the sitemap, mark them with <lastmod>.
Here are the different ways that you can alert Google about your sitemap:
Submit a sitemap using the sitemaps report.
Use the ping tool. Send a GET request in your browser or the command line to this address, specifying the full URL of the sitemap. Be sure that the sitemap file is accessible:
http://www.google.com/ping?sitemap=<full_URL_of_sitemap>
Example:
http://www.google.com/ping?sitemap=https://example.com/sitemap.xml
Insert the following line anywhere in your robots.txt file, specifying the path to your sitemap. We will find it the next time we crawl your site:
Sitemap: http://example.com/my_sitemap.xml
