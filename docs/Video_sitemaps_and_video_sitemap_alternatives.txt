Video sitemaps and video sitemap alternatives
A video sitemap is a sitemap with additional information about video hosted on your pages. Creating a video sitemap is an excellent way to help Google find and understand the video content on your site, especially content that was recently added or that we might not otherwise discover with our usual crawling mechanisms. Google Video Sitemap is an extension to the Sitemap standard.
While Google recommends using video sitemaps, we also support mRSS feeds.
To get the best results in Google Search, follow the video best practices.
Guidelines for video sitemaps
Here are basic guidelines for video sitemaps:
You can create a separate sitemap just for video, or you can embed a video sitemap within an existing sitemap, whichever is more convenient for you.
You can host multiple videos in one web page.
Each sitemap entry is the URL of a page that hosts one or more videos. The structure of each sitemap entry is as follows:
<url>
<loc>https://example.com/mypage</loc>
<!-- URL of host page -->
<video> ... information about video 1 ... </video>
... as many additional <video> entries as you need ...
</url>
Don't list videos that are unrelated to the host page. For example, if the video is a small addendum to the page, or unrelated to the main text content.
Each entry in a video sitemap includes a set of required, recommended, or optional values that you supply. Recommended and optional values provide useful metadata that can enhance your video results and improve Google's ability to include your video in search results. Refer to the list of sitemap elements.
Google might use text on the video landing page rather than the text you supply in your sitemap, if the page text is deemed more useful than the information in the sitemap.
Google can't guarantee when or if your videos will be indexed, as Google relies on complex indexing algorithms.
If Google can't discover video content at the URL you provide, the sitemap entry is ignored.
Each sitemap file that you provide must have no more than 50,000 URL elements. If you have more than 50,000 videos, you can submit multiple sitemaps and a sitemap index file. You can't nest sitemap index files. Keep in mind that if you are adding optional tags, you may reach the 50MB uncompressed limit before you reach the 50,000 video limit.
Google must be able to access the source file or player (that is, the file or player can't be blocked by robots.txt, require a login, or be otherwise inaccessible to Googlebot). Metafiles that require a download of the source via streaming protocols are not supported.
All files must be accessible to Googlebot. If you want to prevent spammers from accessing your video content at the <player_loc> or <content_loc> URLs, verify that any bots accessing your server are really Googlebot.
Make sure that your robots.txt file isn't blocking any of the items (including the host page URL, the video URL, and the thumbnail URL) included in each sitemap entry. More information about robots.txt.
Google verifies that the information you provide for each video matches what is on the site. If not, your video might not be indexed.
You can specify pages from different sites in one sitemap. All sites, including the one containing your sitemap, must be verified in Search Console. More information about managing sitemaps for multiple sites.
Learn how to submit your sitemap to Google. For large sites, we recommend using the Search Console API to submit your sitemaps.
Example sitemap
Here is a sample video sitemap with one page hosting one video. This example includes all of the tags that Google uses.

Tag
Required?
Description
<url>
Required
Parent tag for a single host page on your site. Defined by the basic sitemaps format.
<loc>
Required
Specifies the host page where one or more videos are hosted. When a user clicks on a video result in Google Search, they are sent to this page. This URL must be a unique within the sitemap. Defined by the basic Sitemaps format.
For multiple videos on a single page, create a single
<loc> tag for the page, with a child <video> element for each video on that page.
<video:video>
Required
Parent element for all information about a single video on the page specified by <loc>.
<video:thumbnail_loc>
Required
A URL pointing to the video thumbnail image file. See thumbnail requirements.
<video:title>
Required
The title of the video. All HTML entities should be escaped or wrapped in a CDATA block. We recommend that this match the video title displayed on the web page.
<video:description>
Required
A description of the video. Maximum 2048 characters. All HTML entities should be escaped or wrapped in a CDATA block. It must match the description displayed on the web page (it doesn't need to be a word-for-word match).
<video:content_loc>
Required: either <video:content_loc> or
<video:player_loc>
A URL pointing to the actual video media file. Should be one of the supported formats.
Additional guidelines
HTML and Flash aren't supported formats.
Must not be the same as the <loc> URL.
This is the equivalent of VideoObject.contentUrl in structured data.
Best practice: If you want to restrict access to your content but still have it crawled, ensure that Googlebot can access your content by using a reverse DNS lookup.
<video:player_loc>
Required: either <video:content_loc> or
<video:player_loc>
A URL pointing to a player for a specific video. Usually this is the information in the src element of an <embed> tag.
Additional guidelines
Must not be the same as the <loc> URL.
For YouTube videos, this value is used rather than video:content_loc. This is the equivalent of VideoObject.embedUrl in structured data.
Best practice: If you want to restrict access to your content but still have it crawled, ensure that Googlebot can access your content by using a reverse DNS lookup.

Supported values:
yes: The video is available when SafeSearch is turned on.
no: The video is only available when SafeSearch is turned off.
<video:restriction>
Optional
Whether to show or hide your video in search results from specific countries.
Specify a space-delimited list of country codes in ISO 3166 format. Only one <video:restriction> tag can be used for each video. If there is no <video:restriction> tag, Google assumes that the video can be played in all locations. Note that this tag only affects search results; it doesn't prevent a user from finding or playing your video in a restricted location though other means. Learn more about applying country restrictions.
Attributes:
relationship [Required] Whether the video is allowed or denied in search results in the specified countries. Supported values are allow or deny. If allow, listed countries are allowed, unlisted countries are denied; if deny, listed countries are denied, unlisted countries are allowed.
Example: This example allows the video search result to be shown only in Canada and Mexico:
<video:restriction relationship="allow">CA MX</video:restriction>
<video:platform>
Optional
Whether to show or hide your video in search results on specified platform types. This is a list of space-delimited platform types. Note that this only affects search results on the specified device types; it does not prevent a user from playing your video on a restricted platform.
Only one <video:platform> tag can appear for each video. If there is no <video:platform> tag, Google assumes that the video can be played on all platforms. Learn more about applying platform restrictions.
Supported values:
web - Traditional computer browsers on desktops and laptops.

<video:tag>
Optional
An arbitrary string tag describing the video. Tags are generally very short descriptions of key concepts associated with a video or piece of content. A single video could have several tags, although it might belong to only one category. For example, a video about grilling food may belong in the "grilling" category, but could be tagged "steak", "meat", "summer", and "outdoor". Create a new <video:tag> element for each tag associated with a video. A maximum of 32 tags is permitted.
<video:category>
Optional
A short description of the broad category that the video belongs to. This is a string no longer than 256 characters. In general, categories are broad groupings of content by subject. Usually a video belongs to a single category. For example, a site about cooking could have categories for broiling, baking, and grilling, and the video could belong to one of those categories.
<video:gallery_loc>
Not used
Currently not used.
Sitemap alternative
While Google recommends using video sitemaps and schema.org's VideoObject to mark up your videos, we also support mRSS feeds.
mRSS
Google supports mRSS, an RSS module that supplements the element capabilities of RSS 2.0. mRSS feeds are very similar to video sitemaps and can be tested, submitted, and updated just like sitemaps.
Each mRSS feed must be under 50MB in size when uncompressed, and can contain no more than 50,000 video items. If your uncompressed file is larger than 50MB, or you have more than 50,000 videos, you can submit multiple mRSS feeds and a sitemap index file. Sitemap indexes can contain mRSS feeds.
RSS vs mRSS – mRSS is a RSS extension used for syndicating multimedia files. It allows for a much more detailed description of the content than the RSS standard.
mRSS Example
Here's an example of an mRSS entry that provides all the key tags that Google uses. This includes <dcterms:type>live-video</dcterms:type>, which you can use to identify live, streaming videos.
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
