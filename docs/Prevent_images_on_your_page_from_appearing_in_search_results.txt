Prevent images on your page from appearing in search results
For quick removal
Use the Remove URLs tool
to remove images hosted on your site from Google's search results within hours.
For non-emergency image removal
To prevent images from your site appearing in Google's search results, add a
robots.txt file to the root of the server
that blocks the image. While it takes longer to remove an image from search results than it
does to use the Remove URLs tool, it gives you more flexibility and control through the use
of wildcards or subpath blocking. It also applies to all search engines, whereas the Remove
URLs tool only applies to Google.
For example, if you want Google to exclude the dogs.jpg image that appears on your site at
www.yoursite.com/images/dogs.jpg, add the following to your robots.txt file:
User-agent: Googlebot-Image
Disallow: /images/dogs.jpg
The next time Google crawls your site, we'll see this directive and drop your image from our
search results.
To remove all the images on your site from our index, place the following robots.txt file in
your server root:
User-agent: Googlebot-Image
Disallow: /
Additionally, disallow patterns may include "*" to match any sequence of characters, and
patterns may end in "$" to indicate the end of a name. To remove all files of
a specific file type (for example, to include .jpg but not .gif images), you'd use the
following robots.txt entry:
User-agent: Googlebot-Image
Disallow: /*.gif$
By specifying Googlebot-Image as the User-agent, the images will be excluded from Google
Images. If you would like to exclude the images from all Google searches (including Google Web
Search and Google Images), specify the Googlebot user agent.
How do I remove images from properties that I don't own?
