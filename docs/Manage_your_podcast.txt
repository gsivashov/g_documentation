Manage your podcast
This guide describes how to manage and monitor your podcasts on Google Search.
Preview on Android devices
You can preview how your podcast may look in search results in the Google Search App on
Android. The preview tool generates a QR code, which you can scan on an Android device to see the
experience. Previewing a podcast requires v8.0 or higher of the Google Search App, even though
the experience is available on v6.5 or higher.

Update
Google Podcasts automatically checks for updates to feeds that Google finds on the web, often
as quickly as five minutes. To ensure that the update is noticed quickly, use the
Google
PubSubHubbub site. For example, you could use the Google PubSubHubbub site when you change your
show’s description or release a new episode. Enter your feed URL in the Topic URL field and click
Publish. If you are submitting a feed for the first time and it complies with
the podcast guidelines, your podcast
should be available within a week.
To avoid the manual process of entering a URL, you can automate the process with the
PubSubHubbub API.
Remove
There are several ways to remove a podcast or episode from Google Podcasts. Choose the solution
that best fits your situation.
Remove an episode: Unpublish the episode from your RSS feed by removing
it from the list of items. Depending on a variety of factors, the change may take effect in
as little as five minutes or—in the worst case—as long as a couple days.
Remove a podcast: Block Google by using one of the following solutions:
Use one or both of the following tags, which may take effect within a couple of days:
<googleplay:block>yes</googleplay:block>
<itunes:block>yes</itunes:block>
These tags prevent the podcast from appearing in Google Podcasts, including Google Search,
Google Home, and the Google Podcasts app. These tags don't affect the
visibility of the host page in Google Search.
Use robots.txt to block Googlebot from the RSS
feed, which may take effect within a few weeks.
Report copyright infringement: To remove content from Google's services
under applicable laws (such as copyright infringement), follow our
legal troubleshooter
and select Web Search.
Distribute
To drive more traffic to your podcast from your web page, you can add a button to your
web page with the Google Podcasts app logo. Upon clicking the button, users are directed to your
podcast in the Google Podcasts app on Android devices. If users don't have the Google Podcasts app
installed or are using a different platform (for example, iOS or desktop), they are directed to
the Google Podcasts web page version of your podcast. You
can generate a direct link to
create the link URL.
Generate direct links
You can also download the Google Podcasts brand assets, which include the Google Podcasts icon
and Listen on Google Podcasts badges. Use the badges to link directly to your show or episode
on Google Podcasts wherever you market your podcast. The badges are localized in 49 languages.

Monitor
When a user streams or downloads an episode of your podcast, the episode is obtained directly
from the URL specified in the episode’s <enclosure> tag in the RSS feed. You
can distinguish Google Podcasts requests from other podcast player requests by looking at the user-agent HTTP
header:
Track requests from Google Podcasts by looking for the regular expression
\b(GoogleChirp|GSA)\/.
To split out analytics for Google Podcasts on Android from Google Podcasts on smart
speakers, look for the following regular expressions:
Google Podcasts on Android: \bGSA\/
Google Podcasts on smart speakers: \bGoogleChirp\/
To build the search index, Google periodically crawls RSS feeds
and episodes. However, these requests don't match the user-agent patterns described above, so
the requests don't appear as podcast listeners.
