Mobile-friendliness FAQs
What's the difference between the PageSpeed Insights UX Score and the Mobile-Friendly Test results?
The Mobile-Friendly
Test uses Googlebot to fetch the page. PageSpeed
Insights does not use Googlebot, but fetches the page in a way that mimics how a
real user fetches the page.
This means that the Mobile-Friendly Test
follows
robots.txt rules rules and PSI does not.
If Googlebot is blocked from fetching the page, JavaScript, CSS, or other
resources, the Mobile-Friendly Test may not be able to detect if a page is mobile-friendly.
To
find out if your page is mobile friendly, use the
Mobile-Friendly Test.
I have a separate mobile website on m.example.com,
while my desktop site is at www.example.com. What should I do
with mobile pages on m.example.com that don't have an equivalent
desktop page on www.example.com?
It's fine to have a mobile page without a desktop equivalent (just
make sure these pages don't include a rel="canonical" to a
non-corresponding desktop version). Mobile-only pages need to build a reputation on their
own (in other words, contain unique content, be well-linked from
other pages on your site or the web) because they don't receive shared
indexing signals from an existing desktop version of the page.
Is it okay if I have some pages using responsive design and others using
dynamic serving?
Yes, it's fine to use more than one configuration for your site.
Check that on a page-level basis, each configuration provides the right indications to
search engines (for example, the responsive page has the
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {...} markup
and the dynamic serving page uses the Vary HTTP header).
If you're using a hybrid responsive design (for example, responsive but with images
dynamically served), Google still considers that responsive since the page is nearly the
same. In case of hybrid responsive design, make sure you keep the markup
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {...} and remove
the Vary HTTP header if it's included specifically for Google. If you're
using responsive images, include them in
<picture>
elements.
I have both a mobile website and an app. Any advice?
Build your mobile website and apps with "deep linking capability" or URIs
that provide pointers to specific areas of content. Deep links and URIs provide more acquisition
possibilities for your business through Search or social sharing.
