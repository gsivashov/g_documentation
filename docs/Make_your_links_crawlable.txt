Make your links crawlableGoogle can follow links only if they are an <a> tag with an href attribute.Â Links that use other formats won't be followed by Google's crawlers. Google cannot follow <a> links without an href tag or other tags that perform as links because of script events. Here are examples of links that Google can and can't follow:
Can follow:
<a href="https://example.com">
<a href="/relative/path/file">
Can't follow:
<a routerLink="some/path">
<span href="https://example.com">
<a onclick="goto('https://example.com')">
