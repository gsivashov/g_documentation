Make your links crawlable
Google can follow your links only if they use proper <a> tags
with resolvable URLs:
Use proper <a> tags
Google can follow links only if they are an <a> tag with an href
attribute. Links that use other formats won't be followed by Google's crawlers. Google cannot
follow <a> links without an href tag or other tags that perform a
links because of script events. Here are examples of links that Google can and can't follow:
Can follow:
<a href="https://example.com">
<a href="/relative/path/file">
Can't follow:
<a routerLink="some/path">
<span href="https://example.com">
<a onclick="goto('https://example.com')">
Link to resolvable URLs
Ensure that the URL linked to by your <a> tag is an actual web address that
Googlebot can send requests to, for example:
Can resolve:
https://example.com/stuff
/products
/products.php?id=123
Can't resolve:
javascript:goTo('products')
javascript:window.location.href='/products'
