Google Podcasts
A podcast is an audio program that consists of one or more episodes. Your podcast can show
up on Google in the following ways:
Google Search on all browsers
Google Search App for Android (requires v6.5 or higher of the Google Search App)
Google Podcasts app
Chrome for Android
Google Home
An Action on the Google Assistant
Android Auto
To help Google better understand your podcast,
follow the podcast guidelines. It's
important to note that Google doesn't guarantee that your podcast will show up in any of these
products.
Get started
If you want your podcast to appear in Google Play Music, your podcast must meet the
Google
Play Music podcast RSS feed specifications. The RSS specifications for Google Play
Music and Google Search are complimentary but not identical, so if you enable support for
one, you neither prevent nor enable support for the other.
